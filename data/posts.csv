Eldenring,Ph2seK1ng,Advice for all the people watching SummerGameFest tomorrow,"With SummerGameFest starting in exactly 1 day, and all of being hyped as hell, I just want to say not to panic if Elden Ring isn't shown immediately. It's probably the biggest game on the event and Geoff was here before, he knows how much we are anticipating this game. He'll probably put it as the last showcase because if he would to show it before, all of us would probably leave immediately as the trailer finishes and come here to discuss it and meme even more. It's been teased a lot in the last month, don't be fooled with Geoff's AMA comments, he can't either deny or approve it's presence at the show."

Eldenring,4StringMasterRace,I don't think you all are considering the worst possibility.,"The worst possible outcome in my mind is that elden ring gets revealed tomorrow with a long unedited gameplay trailer, but the game looks terrible. Not the graphics or the frame rate, but the combat and the yakul riding look stiff and hard to control. The world looks lifeless and uninteresting. The weapons are basic longswords and spears. The player character climbs a tall tower to scan the surrounding area, filling in his map. From soft were so worried that they were too ambitious that they dialed it all back too much. 

It's a very unlikely outcome because from soft has a great track record, but even a 1% chance is still infinitely larger than a 0% chance.

Prepare for all outcomes and you'll never be caught off guard."

Eldenring,Shadow-Eater,What I think about Kadokawa Corporation's financial report,"I apologize in advance for my English, what I have written below are just my opinions, so don't take them as absolute truths.

I have read a lot of articles and have trained myself about what Kadokawa Corporation said.

 Kadokawa Corporation said that the money that at the end of the Fiscal Year, therefore the end of March 2022, will not have earned as it was assumed, due to the postponements due to the CoVID-19 in the vidogames sector.

 These words are not saying that Elden Ring will suffer further postponements.

 We know that the product they focus on most is Elden Ring, since as you know by now it seems to be Fromsoftware's greatest, most important and ambitious work, involving George RR Martin, author of ""A Song of Ice and Fire""  .

 How well we lived, Elden Ring didn't come out in December last year due to the complications due to CoVID-19, which has affected the whole world and is still bringing it to its knees.

 We also know that before E3 certainly nothing will come out.

 Assuming the Elden Ring release date is announced at E3, that date will most likely be in December, which is one of the best times for game releases.  This means that Kadokawa has only 4 months to make money on videogames, if they publish it at the beginning of December, but it will certainly be a date around 20th.
 So Kadokawa won't be able to earn more than what we planned to earn by releasing the game a year earlier.  Because of those 12 months of earnings, only a third are left.

 In conclusion, it is no wonder that Kadokawa wrote in the report that they will earn less than they predicted a year earlier.
 Now the only thing to do is to wait for E3 and see what happens, but I personally am quite confident.

Thank you for reading.

Have a good day"

Real hollows saw that shit and smiled and then saw all the complaints and the moderated damage control and smiled some more, ya know they maybe even laughed a little.

Overjoyed even. 

Rumor or factual, E3 update or silence. When it is finally time to open steam and wishlist the game is when it will become a reality. Until then go get a clown nose or 20 of them and strap ur selves in for the long haul. It’s Michael-Zaki we’re talking about.

Eldenring,HorrorPositive,Had a dream,"First of all, i don't know which Flair to even use for this, so im going to put Humor because i think its hilarious what I'm going to tell you. 

Second. I usually remember like 80 to 90% of my dreams. 

And lastly, I'm not predicting or announcing anything, I'm only writing what i actually dreamt about and all details i remember.

We already established that it was a dream so here it goes.

I was at big gathering which was held outside, near me home. There was other things going on but important part was showcase of 3 highly anticipated game. They announced all three of them. Can't remember 3rd place, but 2nd place was resident evil with like 20k people anticipating game (whatever that means), and first was elden ring with 380k people anticipating game.

After that they showed ER teaser. There was zoom in on the guy (i assume it was main character) which he had wings and his top armor had like fur on his shoulders (similar to faraam top armor, but that could be biased because faraam set is my favorite).

Anyway, after that they showed character climbing tree brach and I looked like platforming game until he turned around and plung attacked a tree trunk which had face showing in middle (gameplay sequence looked like wyvern gimmick boss in ds3).

After character plunged or whatever that wqs(boss or just enemy) you had to input button sequence to kill it. Also remember weapon he was using was scythe with glowing top (similar like those enemies in BB when you have 40 insight).

After that they showed map. Now map was not oppen world like Skyrim or other games, but it was more like open world which had own areas and there were small passages between each area (similar like kingdoms of amalur reckoning map but it was much tighter space between each area and paths were not long)

Now for end. When they showed this 10s trailer, at the end they also showed pre-order available with price (65€) and date next to it. Now this will sound stupid, but date was 19th November 2014 (dont ask why or what that means, because i had no idea). I don't remember if date was actual release date or only pre-order date. 

After that date announcement, i knew something wasn't right, so i knew i was dreaming. Here is thing. When i notice that im dreaming, in 99% i wake up afterwards, and same happened here. I woke up and had to write this before i forget things.

I noticed alot of things are biased in my dreams because lots of things look like parts from my favorite games (Ds3 armor, BB weapon).

I still actually remember the felling or happiness i had when they announced ER trailer and i doubt I will forget it anytime soon.

Again, I'm only posting what i was dreaming. I'm not predicting anything.

Sorry for long post."

Eldenring,OneBananaTooFar,My take on Glaive Master Hodir. @OneBananaTooFar,
Eldenring,Stones-Tor,How to figure out Elden Ring's release date,"I think I realized why Fromsoft has been so quite and cryptic up to this point. They've extended their trademark storytelling technique to their promotional campaigns as well. Did you guys really think that fromsoft would just let a leak through like that? Shot in 144p?

No... of course not you tragic thing lord miyazaki would never slip up like that. It's just like item descriptions that are deliberately open ended and vague the same way that fromsoft has been vague about elden ring info. That's also why the trailer is in low resolution it's supposed to be a hint towards the real release date without immediately giving it away. This leaves things somewhat ambiguous but still providing enough clues for the smart minds of r/Eldenring to figure it out.

After all they did mention that this was their most ambitious project so far and what better way than to completely revolutionize the marketing strategy of the game's industry. It also means that that the whole Eldenring is the friends we made along the way shtick isn't completely off, we are already in the beginning stages of Eldenring. Someone tell vaati I'm excited to see his interpretation of the evidence we've collected so far.

I think that the whole tragic thing refers to us hollows who didn't even realize what was going on... till now. It's probably fromsoft's last resort trying to rub it under our noses in a tsundere kind of way. The line ""you've crossed the fog all the way to the rift lands. Well this is the very edge of the map."" refers to fromsoft-tans patience running out with us and our incompetence. The trailer is clearly addressing us the viewers directly challenging us to figure it out instead of us just begging for them to reveal it.

They aren't going to just hold our hands like that and insult our intelligence. This is also why they've changed their approach to marketing so abruptly to weed out the casual fans who's dedication to elden ring was never strong enough to begin with. I also think the fact that one of the characters wearing an eyepatch symbolizes us hollows and how our eyes are yet to open despite the evidence being right in front of us. I'm confident we can figure it out before fromsoft just relents disgusted at our beastly idiocy happy release date hunting hollows!"

(from my knowledge) The edditor is Bandai Namco, so there wouldn't be any legal problem if they directly referenced Dark Souls. If it's a sequel, which I doubt, I just think it's possible, it probably will be something hidden and not that important in the grand scheme of thing, a bit like NieR and Drakengard, if you will."

My plan is to make the character to look like Guts and take those items as early as possible, though we obviously don't have information about how the flow of progression in the game will be.

Miyazaki and many from Fromsoft love Berserk and the author behind it and that is no new information and I am sure that they will put something here and there just like in the Dark Souls series. [Dragonslayer UG](https://imgur.com/a/gyXgDJd) is a reference to Guts' sword"

Eldenring,Akira_Arkais,What kind of secrets would you like to see in Elden Ring?,"For me there's a lot, but there's just two that I really love to see.

First one takes advantage of the day/night cycle, I would love to see a solitaire rock in the middle of nowhere, in a forest. Then you accidentally go back or find it for the first time while the moon is high on the sky, the moonlight rains over the rock and you can see something that wasn't there before: the moonlight greatsword. That's the only way you can find it.

Second one is more of something we've seen before. I don't mind what's the new secret behind it or how it is implemented. But I want to see again an apparently innocent interaction with something, something funny or mundane that doesn't seem to have any importance. But if you keep this interaction for a time (like the nest in the firelink shrine) then triggers an event that leads you to a secret that's tied to more secrets in the game (like how you find the doll going back to the asylum and that's how you can enter the painted world)."

Ds1 that one demon in that tiny ass room, it is essentially rng if you're able to make it past the first 5 seconds because it all depends on what the enemies first do and how little room there is to manuver

Ds2 Nashandra is my pick for this game because she is underwhelming. I obliterated her without getting hit at all and killing her in like 7 or 8 hits, very disappointed. Also fuck the Gank squad in the dlc

Ds3 Curse rotted Greatwood boring boss with dumb mechanics and terrible music

In this sense, to make Elden Ring spicier, a system I'd like to find starting from NG+ would be a kind of randomization of the bosses' patterns, within the limits of what the animation and the transitions between different attacks can offer. 

Let's say a boss that, in close range, has access to 4 types of attacks, a 3 hit combo A B C, another two-hit combo D E, a grab and an AoE attack, and so on. It would be interesting for players who play these games often, if there was a system that would allow the bosses to change the usual patterns, and thus force the player to rely less on memory and more on reflexes. For example, the boss could do a combination A B E instead of A B C, he could start directly with B or do D A B or D A C. Or A B and then the grab, and so on. This way it would make the fights more fun. Imagine what it would be like for battles like Champion Gundyr, Pontiff, Soul of Cinder, Artorias, Gwyn, or Orphan of Kos.

Without taking into account the difficulties related to the programming and animation of this feature, what do you think? I would apply this to NG+ and above only, so that the base game doesn't change and challenge runs don't become too wild."

Eldenring,closynuff,What do you think the blood will look like?,"Expecting bloodborne level blood is propably not realistic. DS3 had pretty boring blood imo, kind of brown rather than red. Sekiro didn’t really have any blood stay on you except for the moment you kill the big snake, in which case it looked really good. DeS remake was kind of on the more realistic side of things - looked great, but I just love the over the top ammounts of blood in BB. Do you think we’ll be able to get soaked in actual red blood or will it be toned down again to not draw so much attention?"
Eldenring,Bolt_om,Elden ring will probably the last Fromsoft game without an easy mode,"This is just my speculation. But the easy mode debate has really been ramping up these last few days, and it's going to explode when elden ring comes out. Soon it will basically be unacceptable to release a difficult game without assists. Fromsoft will have to give in.

So yes enjoy it while it lasts or be excited for the inevitable easy mode. This is just how the industry is going. I don't make the rules."

Eldenring,boi_was_taken,3 theories 1 post,"Unofficial ideas
Hey I have three theories but don’t want to make them three post so here they all are. Also I’m using my voice to type considering I’m on mobile and this would be really annoying to type manually
Theory 1
Ambushes/forced confrontation 
So since this is going to be an open world/big souls game I think in the more open areas there could be ambushes also I saw a post talking about this topic and just wanted to give my idea. So imagine you are riding Your horse when suddenly an arrow hit you in the stomach which makes you fall off your horse and then three Bandits or swamp creatures it depends on the area, Appear out of nowhere and now you’re forced into a fight. Also Kind a like how in other souls born games you have to hit certain triggers to progress the game Like ringing the bells in dark souls one. Now imagine you have to kill like two bosses or do certain triggers like breaking into a throne room to kill the multiple armed boss But instead of having some time to breathe after doing these actions you’re forced straight into the Boss fight. Like far cry 5 and you wouldn’t be able to fast travel out of the location
Theory 2
Parrying/stats
Now based on what we’ve seen in the trailers I think there are going to be two types of parrying systems one of them will be sword parrying  which would be like Sekiro shadows die twice and also shield pairing which would be similar to dark souls but I’ve only seen the summer game fest trailer and so  if they are only going to pick one type of system I would assume it would be Sekiro style. And for stats more classes would be nice where you could Add more To the classes like you were given five points to spend on the stats at the beginning of the game.

Theory 3
Final boss idea
Now I know this is sort of a cliché final boss but I feel like it could work really well in Elden ring. And that would be (drum rolllllllllllllllll) Mirror fight now let me explain so imagine in one of them endings we absorb the power of the Elden ring but based on some items we may have gotten or some fight with Miss or some NPC‘s we may have talked to we managed to survive the power of the ring and once we wake up after absorbing it we see a copy of our character so if we have white clothes on they would be wearing black clothes and we use the power of the Eldin ring to make A copy of the weapon we were using before hand but stronger and then we go into a fight against ourselves and they have everything we have use of this point so same weapon equipped just not as strong they have the same stats and the same armour. Now this fight could be either easy or difficult I’m not really sure it’s just food for thought."

Eldenring,Duke_Downing,Stealth System,"In the trailer, we saw that you could crouch. So that begs the question of whether or not if there will be a similar stealth mechanic like in Sekiro. Where it's a slow detection system. Or it's going to be more similar to DS, where you can crouch and slowly sneak behind them but there is no detection and you'll only know when you failed in your stealth when they turn around and start attacking you."
Eldenring,kakomamushi,Areas you and me *know* are gonna be in the game without even paying attention to the trailer,"1) A poison area, probably located very deep underground but it could also be out in the open. Whatever the case may be, Miyazaki loves his Shrek swamps.

2) A lava area, filled with items on small surface rocks that I'm gonna lose many, many souls trying to get.

3) A place filled with traps and narrow bridges.

4) A really dark place, probably filled with skeletons or werewolves.

Keep adding your own

Can't wait for Blightown 5.0"
Eldenring,DoctorRimjobBukkake,"If you personally could, what game mechanic would you add in that would absolutely set this apart from all “Soulslike” games?",
Eldenring,CrazyAnonymousGuy1,What if we have already seen some of the powers of the Great Runes.," 

In the IGN interview, Miyazaki said ""(*about the demigods*) And part of the design of these major characters is that in inheriting the shards of the Elden Ring, they each inherited a different power or element, so to speak, and each was twisted and warped in its own way, and it brought a tainted strength to each of them. They each fell to madness and fell to ruin in their own individual ways."". I take this to mean the corruption of the demigods differs between them and I began to think what if the corruption spread to their close advisors or friends as well. If there is a spreading of corruption, I think I just found at least 2. In the Elden Ring trailer, we see a theme present for at least 2 enemies twice. The first theme is the attachment of limbs and the second is the wolf/tiger people.

I'll start with the wolf/tiger people whom I'll call the furries from now on. The two furries, for those who don't know, are the artorias furry and the acrobat furry. In one of the scenes from the trailer, we see a room with floating debris, pillars of dog skeletons, and a golden rune, we also who this is where the furry acrobat fight takes place. What if the dog skeletons signify that this demigod was barbaric and brutish, and thus turned into a literal animal as corruption. Assuming these are related, I think it's worth pointing out that Miyazaki says ""inherited a different power or element"", I think element refers to the undesirable trait, in this case, barbarism. It's possible the dog skeletons were added after the great rune was found, this is because inherited usually means you get it from somewhere else, and inheriting an element is like becoming barbaric. The artorias furry was likely someone who was a close advisor or even friend to the acrobat furry which is why he's also a furry. I also think the artorias furry is hunting the player. The demigods would know the tarnished are here to kill them as you are not the only one, so it makes sense to have someone they can trust to hunt you down. I also think he returns regularly and I'll explain why later on.

For the multi-limbed people, we see 2 or 3 figures with this, the first one is the centipede guy, I think this guy is a general or some other high ranking military soldier, remember that war was happening at this time so the king and his generals would work closely together. The second is the multi-armed boss himself, and this boss was already confirmed to be a demigod. The third possible figure affected by the Elden Ring is the scorpion tail guardian, I call him a guardian because he is probably in the same role as the artorias furry, someone to guard his king. He is also less corrupted than the artorias furry and the multi-arm demigod because he was put on guard duty and was not with the multi-armed demigod as long as the generals. As with the furries, I think there is a theme to corruption. The corruption here is greed and the multiple hands signify more hands to grab treasures, which is why they all were crowns and the demigod and a giant golden ax. I also think this trait was gain after the demigod found the great rune because of the lack of gold everywhere."

Eldenring,Lachlanmaximus,Speculation,"Okay hear me out. So in the Miyazaki interview he mentions how the demigods have gained powers and abilities from the shards of the elden ring.

Eldenring,KeewiwiA7X,Found this cool fanart!,
Eldenring,MrRedoot55,A little thing I’d like to see in Elden Ring are more ambient boss tracks.,"In the Demon’s Souls remake, the music for each boss was made more ambient - it would start playing in the opening cutscene (If there was one attached), then come to a clear stop when said boss was defeated.

It was a small touch, but I liked it anyway. It made the experience a little more immersive, in my opinion.

With Elden Ring about to release, something I would appreciate is the boss music being more ambient, like it was in the remake. I wouldn’t mind if it isn’t included, but I’m sure it’d be a nice small detail.

What do you think?"
Eldenring,No_Blacksmith_1609,How should ambushes be handled?,"Hey everyone,

So I know ambushes are a sort of controversial topic because some people truly hate gank oriented level design. It makes sense though, dying carries a heavy toll and ambushes are sometimes used to predict.

That said, I love ambushes in soulsbornes. When I play they force me to slow down and make my progression very calculated instead of blinding rushing forward.

Elden ring is definitely going to be the biggest and most open game we've played from Fromsoft, so I'm curious how they will plan them around such a big open space.

Do you think they will be isolated into the main dungeons? Littered throughout the world? A little bit of both?"

Eldenring,Herald_of_Zena,Elden Ring Bosses Hype-Analysis Guide,"1) ***LION KNIGHT***: 

* Difficulty: Hard. His attacks are extremely unpredictable, and he also has a lot of verticality in his moveset; he jumps around the arena. His damage will be great, but not tremendous. 
   * Gimmicks: Unpredictable Attacks, wild and erratic movement to make the player panic. If you panic, you will die.
* Health Pool/ Damage:
   * Health Pool: Pontiff Sullyvhan levels of HP
   * Damage Levels: Lorian &amp; Lothric levels

2) ***HECATONCHIRES KING***: 

* Difficulty: 
   * Hard if you are impatient, Difficult if you aren't. His attacks will likely be fairly telegraphed, but they will deal tremendous damage. Especially his axe attack because *two arms are holding axes* in his left arm, so a swing will be followed up by an additional swing (like Gaels' Cape) which will deal tremendous double damage if you aren't careful. 
* Gimmicks: 
   * Double-damaged Axe Swings (like Gael's Cape)
   * Two phases:
      * Phase 1, he can grab attack you with his other arm, with ease. 
      * Phase 2, he will get the DRAGON ARM, and will Ring Knight the fuck out of you if you aren't careful, followed by BITE attacks too. 
* Health Pool / Damage: 
   * Health Pool: Demon Prince (final phase)
   * Damage Levels: Gael levels of damage.

3) ***RED VALKYRIE***: 

* Difficulty: Difficult
* Gimmicks: 
   * Attacks are faster than the norm. 
   * It's hard to predict her Grab attack.
* Health Pool / Damage:
   * Health Pool: Around the same as Black Flame Friede
   * Damage Levels: Dancer of the Boreal Valley

4) ***WHITE DRAGON***: 

* Difficulty:
   * Difficult. This boss will require the mount, so having a good grasp of the mount mechanics is crucial. If not, you will have a hard time. The dragon also seems to cause lightning to linger on the floor, so spatial awareness is also important. This boss isn't hard in the conventional sense,  it is hard because it will have a lot of ""moving pieces"" a lot of skills to utilize.
* Gimmicks: Requires a good grasp of mounted mechanics.
* Health pool / Damage:
   * Health Pool: Demon Prince (last phase)
   * Damage Levels: Yhorm levels of damage

5) ***SPECTRAL REINDEER***: 

* Difficulty: 
   * Medium. Slightly annoying when it floats. It will have one really punishing charge attack which deals a lot of damage, so watch out on that! In the second phase it probably goes apeshit like Vordt and the Gravetender Wolf does.
* Gimmicks: 
   * Slow-homing magic! 
   * One charge attack which deals a TON of damage!
   * Some segments will require the mount!
* Health Pool / Damage: 
   * Health Pool: Ebrietas
   * Damage Levels: Demon of Hatred 

6) ***GHRU LORD***: 

* Difficulty:
   * Medium. Pretty straightforward fight. Very predictable aside from the times in which it spawns ephemeral golden weapons in the battle. Does a lot of, highly-telegraphed, follow-ups to attacks. Watch out for those.
* Gimmicks:
   * Ephemeral golden weapons, which are spawned unpredictably across the battle. 
   * Lots of follow-up attacks.
* Health Pool / Damage:
   * Health Pool: Crystal Sages levels of HP
   * Damage Levels: Vordt Levels of Damage

7) ***MOON PRIEST***:

* Difficulty: Intermediate (In-between easy and medium)
   * He has a small health pool, which makes up for his high damage, making him a medium-tier difficulty boss. He will probably be the ""annoying boss"" because of his magic. The Aldrich of Elden Ring, even though he is easier in terms of having low HP.
* Gimmicks:
   * MAGIC! LOTS AND LOTS OF MAGIC!
   * Teleportation probably
* Health Pool / Damage:
   * Health Pool: Abyss Watchers (first phase) 
   * Damage Levels: Gwyndolin (Dark Souls 1)"

It whould make sense to have a painting of the ""King"" in your castle that is actually your father.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello Elden ring will be my first souls game i have played Blood borne, Dark souls 3 , Sekiro but I have used Guides and maps to help me. I have never figured it out or gotten gud to figure out how to open onion's cell which I thought was in the dungeon but it was in the profaned capital and i wasted 3 hours running around the dungeon. But my point is I try to get the 'good endings' in these games, and i'm not good at finding hidden areas like unetended graves. Or been able to beat a boss hitless. And normally its fine cause npc's don't effect anything besides giving your some items. But in Elden ring the Npc's effect your story and going in as new souls player I don't have a keen eye for figuring out how to get to secret areas to affect my story for the good. And so what i want some advice about how to understand npc questlines and how to check area's correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr I need advice on how to  about how to understand npc questlines and how to check area's correctly."

Eldenring,Emniya,"We're almost there, hit that replay button",
Eldenring,Orefounder,The areas of Elden Ring,"So we know that there are at least 6 different zones in the game, but looking at the maps made from what we've seen from the trailer, I think we have a wrong frame of reference. What if all (or at least most) of the open world shots are just from the same starting zone? The sheer size of the map is making me giddy with excitement."
Eldenring,FifthKnightofGwyn,Good news guys! We're now less than 10 million seconds away from Elden Ring's release!!!!!,
Eldenring,HadesTheGrim,Isn't it clearly hinted that the gods destroyed the elden ring even though it hurt them very badly as they were linked?,"This is clearly a sad thing for those involved. It a tragic necessity. The elden ring must have been doing harm in the long run, and thus these powerful beings shattered it. This leads me to assume it's problem was that it was too dense a consecration of power and that it was literally leaching the rest of existence outside the lands in betwee. If not to the point of death, than removing perhaps that kind of energy from the rest of the world/universe. By shattering it the gods...? may have been trying to restore balance to a world being made too disparate. They knew it would be a horrible thing in the short to midterm for the lands in-between at least, yet they did it anyway. Clearly they had a reason and since the more they damaged the elden ring the more they were damaged, it's clear they're linked. That leads me to assume they are the gods the originally crafted the elden ring. Only after that to realize it was harmful. admittedly I'm assuming and reading into things a lot.

I assumed all of this be the end of my first watch of the fist trailer years ago. I'm surprised nobody has gotten the same thing of of it? I assumed it was a common theory, so I never made a post, but since it doesn't seem to be, I'd like to call it now. Discuss below, please let me know what you think."

Eldenring,IwaitforEldenRing,Some thoughts on stealth combat in Elden Ring,"I recently replayed The Last of Us 2 for the third time and started to think that Elden Ring could take some lessons from this game's combat, particulary stealth.

I'm not really a stealth games guy, but I've seen some gameplays from older metal gears and dishonored, so I allowed myself to have some opinions about them. I think that tlou2 did a great job in making stealth combat interesting, engaging and visualy impresive by making it really dynamic and making player be able to quickly switch playstyle from open fight to being an assasin and vice versa. It might be a standard now in modern stealth games, like I said, I'm not up to date. My point is that a game like Elden Ring would imo highly benefit from having this type of stealth combat instead of what we have seen in sekiro. It would make stealth builds more interesting, accualy viable in pvp, and make using bow potentialy very interesting.

My second idea isn't really about combat but about enemy design. I love fighting stalkers in tlou2. Such a scary, and smartly crafted enemy. That horrible fealing when you enter a dark room, you can't see anything dangerous, but you know that you're accually surrounded by enemies that only wait for you to turn your back. I would really like to see similar enemy in some horror area if elden ring will have one, or meaby a mini boss that stalks you thrue an area, attacking only when your discracted by other enemies and backing up whenever he feals like he's loosing. Bassicly an invader controlled by a computer.

What are your ideas on possible ways to use stealth mechanics in elden ring?"
Eldenring,Outrageous-kicks,Any one else so excited for Elden ring cause there new?,"Like I’m fairly new to the soulsboure games and have never bought a fame on release. That’s why I’m so excited to play Elden ring, I can play the game at the same time as everyone else, discover the secrets at the same time as everyone else, read item descriptions find secrets everything. That’s mainly why I’m so excited, I only played my first one last year, started with ds3, then ds, and now bloodborne, taking a break thoe as I played the, back to back and felt like a hollow. But I’m planing to finish bloodborne and play sekiro. So yeah, just wondering if anyone else is like this, so experience something truly new with everyone else, no websites, no story videos just you and your controller"
Eldenring,C0LMU574RD,A question from a somewhat new FromSoftware fan,"I recall someone mentioning, in the comments of a much earlier post, that the reason FromSoft can get away with minimal/no footage from Elden Ring and still get so much hype from the fanbase and community, is because of all of the credibility and respect that the developers have (No, this isn't me saying that they need to release the footage, this is clearly different from Cyberpunk, ya clowns).

My question is, what does everyone think FromSoftware done to facilitate a community that respects them the way that we do? Is it just the solid game streak (even the so-called ""Worst"" game, Dark Souls 2, is incredibly solid, if perhaps clunky at times)? Or is it something different? I only hopped on the train kinda recently, when Playstation+ had the deal on Bloodborne, and Dark Souls 1 only a year ago (Still haven't beaten it yet), so i don't know what else they may have done"

But I also want to play a ""paladin"", so a mix between strength and faith with a shield and 1h mace or sword. Especially now that faith finally seems to have a lot of interesting offensive options and not just mostly defensive tools. 

The thing is though, that you rarely find all the best things on your first playthrough, and I rarely if ever replay the same class once, so maybe I'll just go 2h strength and hope that the community have found out where the best miracles are located for my second playthrough. I mean I could always try on my first playthrough, but the most powerful spells are often hidden way too well for me to figure out how to find them, so I let the community do that for me.

I am a lowly Tarnished from the shattered world of Romania. 

My experience began with Dark Souls and since then I have been enthralled with FromSoft games.

I finally managed to save up some hardearned runes in order to purchase the fantastically designed Collector's Edition of Elden Ring.

Unfortunately my timing for this, as in many boss fights, was not great, and they are all sold out, for all the platforms. 

Are there any means of getting one? Like someone decided not to go ahead with their purchase, or maybe even a re-stock plan in the works?

Eldenring,js100serch,Should I pay Scalper price for CE or wait for probably nothing...,"Hi everyone.

**I'm from Mexico City, and apparently Bandai Namco Latin America won't be distributing the CE here**. I was told this by my friends from a popular gaming youtube channel who have a relationship with the brand as game journalists. Not 100% sure but most likely that will be the case.

**So here in Mexico we have our version of eBay, where the Elden Ring CE is being sold for $450 dollars**, the seller has a good reputation, he is a Gold Seller, 6 years selling on this website. And the way he is selling the CE is not that predatory?, in a way?... because **he is asking for $60 dollars to reserve yours and the rest a a week after launch.** Everything will be done through the website's secure payment and shipping methods. 

What should I do?, give up and pay this guy $450 god damn dollars or wait and hope for the best, because **I have a friend in the US who told me that he will gladly send me one in case it gets restocked or if he finds one.** 

Thank you."

Eldenring,One_Armed_Wolf,Response to some of the more low-effort criticisms,"They've been stating Elden Ring was intended to be a successor to Dark Souls since the first information cycles and that it's meant to usher in a new era for FromSoftware. It's only more of the same in the sense that it's another FromSoftware Souls category game and was designed to build off of the foundations of previous games.

It's by definition not Dark Souls 4 because it's not only an entirely new universe and setting with accompanying lore, but it's also been stated that they started development with the goal of designing it around systems that they either couldn't implement in past games or always had an interest in attempting (open world traversal, mounted gameplay, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand why it being a melting pot of most of the previous games should be considered a negative.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a cross-gen release, started development during the DLC for DS3, and their focus has never been in the same areas that a dev like Bluepoint or certain other major first party studios would be. All of those factors considered, detracting it from pure graphical fidelity alone seems unreasonable. I actually think it's a step up from DS3 and Sekiro in some regards.

&amp;#x200B;

The art style itself is recognizable/comparable to the other games because it's the exact same director (who often has a very specific overall aesthetic in mind) and his team. It also has a few marked differences like more vivid color palettes and a seemingly intentional direction to feel even more 'mythical' this time around. Also a more deliberate flavor of ancient Celtic/Nordic influence in the art and world design than they've ever used before.

They've been reusing animation, model, and audio assets here and there since DS1. Even Demon's Souls had a few examples of that and it's never been a legitimate or major issue in gameplay whenever they incorporate some of those resources into a project.

&amp;#x200B;

The game is most likely not going to feel ""too short"" and the map is not going to be ""too small"", whether the speculation on them maybe having planned ER to be expanded into a series rings true or not. First impressions with a new IP seem to be very important to From, especially when factoring in uncharted territory and interviews/advertising have highlighted details such as size and scale in comparison to what has come before as one of the primary features.

&amp;#x200B;

We know that the network test area was only a portion of the known map and I believe that each region is separated between chunks of map/larger fragments. The portion of that same known map shown in the gameplay preview that's connected to Limgrave might only be 1-3 complete chunks of the overall game area, give or take. All of this is excluding the likely existence of an underground zone that's it's own unique beast separate from the scattered mini dungeons like the caves and crypts and anything else that would be an exception.

&amp;#x200B;

The minor bosses that were present in those same caves/crypts are probably comparable as bosses to the ones from BB's chalice dungeons. They basically serve the same purpose except the actual locations they're housed in are probably a bit more handcrafted. The player seems to have a lot of versatility and damage opportunities right off the bat in ER, so that combined with mechanics like the guard counter and the fact that everything we've seen is still from relatively early means that they aren't going to be fights that are all that complex, challenging, or lore heavy. I think it would be strange to expect them to be on par with the mainline bosses like Margit, who's pretty damn advanced moveset and presentation wise for what's presumably one of the first bosses in the game."

Eldenring,Cloranth,"If Melina is Odin, we can guess her purpose","While looking around the various lores here, I suddenly came up with a new theory.

First of all, this is not certain at all. I'm just writing it down here because I think the theory that came to mind is quite plausible. Don't believe it so seriously.

For your information, I am Korean and this article is translated into a translator. Because of this, there may be some strange parts in the text. I hope you understand that.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, this theory is based on the premise that Melina is Odin. The evidence that Melina may be Odin is written in more detail in another theory, so please refer to it. In this theory, I will only point out the necessary parts.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Odin and Melina's left eye**

&amp;#x200B;

Odin was famous for his great greed for wisdom. Odin gained vast wisdom after sacrificing his eyes out of the Mimir's well(Mímisbrunnr). And It is said that Mímisbrunnr was at the foot of Yggdrassil, more specifically under the roots of Yggdrassil extending to Yotunheim.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, Odin inserted his spear gungnir poke into his body, hung himself on Yggdrassil, and focused on meditation to gain the wisdom of the underworld.  And on the 9th, Odin's spirit escaped from the bondage of the present world and reached the underworld. After returning from traveling to the underworld, Odin even gained the wisdom of the underworld. The wisdom Odin gained from the underworld was Wisdom of the Runes.

&amp;#x200B;

Connecting this to Melina, you can infer Melina's purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

Melina closes one eye and also asks the player to take her to the foot of the Erdtree. After that, Melina said, *""Me, I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree long ago, for the reason that I yet live, burned and bodyless""*. After that, Melina says that her body has burned down. Looking at Melina's current condition, she looks like a kind of spirit.

In fact, Melina says in the Japanese version that her body is *""burned, and now she is a spirit's body""*.

&amp;#x200B;

Melina's body burned down can be linked to Odin's sacrifice. Odin sacrificed his body to go to the underworld, and Melina burned her body and wandered around the land between as a spirit body.

Odin learned the wisdom of Rune in the underworld and returned to the foot of Yggdrassil, where his body is. And the land between where Melina travels is the world of a rune. Melina wants to go to the foot of Erdtree.

This allows you to guess two things: Melina wants to go to the foot of the Erdtree to find her burned body.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**2. The flame of madness that burned her body**

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I found something related to Melina in the spell ""The fire of Frenzy"".

The fire of Frenzy is a spell to accumulate Madness by firing a flame attack ahead, and the spell description is as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*An incantation from the maddening Three Fingers.*

*Causes the yellow flame of frenzy to burst forth from the caster's eyes.*

*This incantation can drive human foes mad, and charging up makes it more powerful.*

*Those whose eyes are afflicted with the flame of frenzy are racked with maddening pain and unstoppable tears.*

&amp;#x200B;

This spell seems to be related to Melina.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Melina is closing her left eye. And these left eyes are engraved with patterns similar to tattoos or seals. As can be seen from the starting motion and explanation of The fire of Frenzy, this spell fires from the ""eye"". That's also ""The fire of Frenzy"".
2. Melina's motif, as I said, is almost certainly Odin. And Odin's name means ""Frenzy"" in ancient Nordic. It seems to have a big connection to ""The fire of Frenzy"".
3. As described before, Melina says in the Japanese version that her body is ""burned, and now she is a spirit's body"". I feel like it's related to ""The fire of Frenzy"".

&amp;#x200B;

What can be guessed from this is that the fire that Melina burned with her eyes closed is ""The fire of Frenzy"", that is, a flame of madness.

As I said, Odin sacrificed his eyes and gained wisdom at the foot of Yggdrassil. Let's connect this to Melina. Then Melina would have faced something similar to the source of madness at the foot of Erdtree, and would have been attracted by it and sacrificed her eyes. After losing his eyes, he would have burned her body. Just as Odin sacrificed himself to travel to the underworld.

Also, considering that Odin's name means ""Frenzy"", Melina may have become something related to madness by facing something similar to the source of madness.

Then, what is at the foot of the Erdtree?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Melina's purpose**

&amp;#x200B;

If you think about it more here, Melina may be purposing for Elden Ring.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/querzl/the\_lands\_between\_what/hks08dv/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/querzl/the_lands_between_what/hks08dv/)

According to the theory of this link, the prototype of the Elden Ring is six great runes.

As I said, Odin sacrificed himself to travel to the underworld to get the wisdom of the underworld that he wanted so much, and the wisdom of the underworld was Rune's wisdom. Also, as I said, Melina is presumed to have burned her body to travel through the land between. Considering that what Odin wanted to gain from the journey to the underworld was Rune's wisdom, perhaps Melina's purpose of travel was also the collection of great Rune.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, ""Considering that Odin's name means ""Frenzy"", Melina may have become something related to madness by facing something similar to the source of madness"" If you think about this word in connection with the theory at the link above, ""The each great rune has different properties and twists the owner's spirit around the concept he embodies"", Melina's view at the foot of the Erdtree and what she sacrifices her eyes would be ""A great rune with the attributes of madness and wisdom"". Just as Odin sacrificed his eyes and gained wisdom.

&amp;#x200B;

So then Melina's purpose would be to take the rest of the great rune from Demigods with the Tarnished, betray the Tarnished at the end, and become Elden Lord herself. As if Odin had traveled to the underworld and gained the wisdom of Rune.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, it's a simple hypothesis but I hope it's interesting. If you have any other good opinions, please let me know in the comments."

I think being too hyped/having unrealistic/too much expectations is bad for us (gamers). Because it leaves us too disappointed after that and usually the game isn't worth it (not this case obviously).

Lately the launches of games went down with quality, therefore preordering is a huge risk.

Just to summarize, we have great imagination and games can't live up to this potential, so maybe next time don't sabotage yourself? :D

Eldenring,douglaskim,Propose to your SO by giving them an Elden Ring,"Following valentines, here's a pro tip: tell your SO you're gonna give them an engagement ring, and give them Elden Ring. 
Worst case scenario, you laugh it off and move on, best case scenario you get insight on what their reaction would be with an actual engagement ring.
Bestest case scenario, they're swooned by both possibilities and you realize they're a keeper! :D"

I think my favorite moment / the moment I knew we were doomed for a long wait was when we became a [Wooper subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/kau5jw/fuck_it_were_a_wooper_subreddit_now/)."
Eldenring,gtwicee,Help finding a post,"Howdy fellow Tarnished, I’m looking for a post that was made sometime when we first saw gameplay at the summer game fest. It was a compilation of like the whole ridiculous timeline of this sub with this song from the ps3 game Rain playing. It was gold and I forgot to save it, anyways thanks in advanced."
Eldenring,bobazoole,I changed my mind,Hello I changed my mind now I want to play elden I'm getting a bit bored with the dark soul  serie so I'ma just gonna wait for thjs
Eldenring,no-u-great-grand,Found this! What do you guys think??,
Eldenring,LyzbietCorwi,Have you been doing something other than suffering with the wait?,"Today I released how fucked up my life is with the wait for Elden Ring. I decided to work today and I'll work again tomorrow, just because I can't seem to focus on any game or any entertainment activity that I enjoy normally. There was at least 5 games that I tried to start during this past week and haven't been able to play for more than 10 minutes.

I saw that the Red Bull stream was on with ER earlier today but felt that if I waited this much, I can wait the 5 remaining days (which seems like 5 years). I just hope work can keep my head busy enough so time go on faster until friday."
Eldenring,RunnerBunny483,Queen Marika The Eternal location theory,"It's just my theory but it's spoilery so please stop reading if you're the kind of person who reads theories and then regrets reading them casue ""shit, what if it's true"" even if it's a wild theory. 

-In the intro that was leaked few days ago the narrator mentions that Queen Marika banished and now she's nowhere to be found. 
-When he talks about her offsprings a picture of the snow witch / the storyteller is shown. That made me think that maybe she's one of Marika's daughters and maybe she's another demigod. 

-Melina says her purpose is lost and now she's bodyless. There are a lot of theories about how she's  the ""ghost"" that shares half of her face with the snow witch, kind of like if those two were twins. 
-Melina says that her mother is inside the erdtree

There you go. It's just speculation. I might be wrong about everything that I said but I felt like sharing my thoughts with you cause I kinda miss when this sub was about fake lore and wild speculation.

Also sorry for my bad english. Please forgive my grammar mistakes."

Eldenring,rando720,Thoughts on new HUD?,Talking about the one from the redbull stream. To me it looks good but it feels too bold at the same time.

Eldenring,LikeSevenButts,Dumbass song I made while waiting for ELDEN RING,"[https://soundcloud.com/eetraight/ohhhhhhhhhhh?utm\_source=clipboard&amp;utm\_medium=text&amp;utm\_campaign=social\_sharing](https://soundcloud.com/eetraight/ohhhhhhhhhhh?utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

Stupid song I made tonight cause I couldn't contain the hype"
Eldenring,r17v1,Nature of reviews,"I noticed a lot of people being really concerned with wanting ER's Metacritic score to be 97/100 and stuff like that. Something ppl need to understand is that TASTE exist, and reviews shows the TASTE of the reviewer. It doesn't matter how much you like the game, it can always not be the cup of tea of someone else. So please instead of flaming reviewers that give lower scores, accept the reviews. 

Ever wonder why CP received high scores at start and later started to receive lower scores? Thats because people were scared to give it low score. Backlash prevents people from giving honest opinions which further makes these scores less reliable. Similar thing can be said about ER, every reviewer knows that giving ER anything less than 8 will me met with criticism, and might even make them loose favor from bandai namco. Yet, even after that if they review it poorly, it will only show their sincerity. It is not sth they should be flamed for, rather they should be praised for being honest. Its easy to give everything 9/10 and 10/10 like IGN does, whats hard is giving sth that has a cult following 6/10."
Eldenring,SeparateTreacle3770,Theory,"Just a theory for Elden ring, i think Melina is a child of queen marika and the people that did the stuff to melina's eye is the same people who killed Godwyn the golden, or something along that line. I especially belive she is a daughter of queen marika. She is also trying to find her mother that is far far away and her mom is probally at the foot of the Er tree that goes along with the fact that queen marika desipere.  I also think Melina has a lot more power than we think because there is some dialog that she says that points in a direction of that."

Then when I finally get to the Erdtree, it turns out it's rejecting people to take that title and you have to essentially burn it so you can get past the barrier and get inside.

Ok, so far so good. I understand all this.

But then... as soon as we get the fire from the forbidden land and the Erdtree is set on fire... I get teleported to this place?

Eldenring,dr1zzzt,Question about how weapon scaling works,"Howdy all,

Could someone explain how weapon scaling works when a weapon scales with multiple attributes?

As an example, let's say we have a weapon that scales at B for strength and D for dexterity. Is there a point to levelling dexterity up for that particular weapon?

I guess the question is, does the scaling take into account all attributes or is it safe to assume by choosing to level whatever the best scaling attribute for a weapon up is (in this case strength) it will always be more beneficial than levelling dexterity up.

In a scenario where say for example it scales with 3 attributes, all at C, does that basically mean you can choose to level any of the 3 up to get the scaling benefits?

Thanks everyone!"

It's interesting, because it doesn't seem to do the frame drops and periodic big slow downs quite like PC, but it's almost like it's \*always\* as slow as those pieces. Not exactly.

I've adapted as I have spent more time on the PS4 Pro and have stayed away from the PC version. Gotten accustomed to the 30 FPS or whatever.

You know what the biggest realization I've had is, though? I was really doing a disservice to the game when I was playing it without HDR. On the PS4 Pro, I have good HDR on my OLED TV and this game really deserves it. It looks great especially in caves and such.

(I've never had any luck getting HDR to work properly on my PC even on monitors that support it. It seems like HDR is just a huge mess with Windows 10)"

I think we can see the shape of Marika &amp; Radagon's Great Runes in-game, represented through various items.

Marika's is most obvious: it's the shape of a Effigies of the Marty that you use to summon other players, the lower lip of a circle and a line descending from it, the top-most part, or one of the middle parts of the Elden Ring. &gt;!This mirrors the position Marika is in at the end of the game!&lt; Another place you can see this design is Marika's Scarseal, where the shape is scarred into the eye.

Radagon's is also visible on his corresponding item, Ragadon's Scarseal. It's a square crosshatching pattern. This is also visible as the background to Radagon's Statue in the capital:

Eldenring,Chompers22,My Personal Comparision of Elden Ring Vs Dark Souls 3 (Spoiler Warning for both games),"**This is 100% my opinion and not to be taken objectively** and I'm not gonna talk about DLC as ER doesn't have one yet. I'll start this with a preface that Dark Souls 3 is the only other Fromsoft game I've finished, I tried to get into DS, got past the gargoyles, and then into the bottom of the dark area which has those annoying unkillable enemies, and dropped the game. Next up I tried Sekiro which I enjoyed a lot but I really missed the build varieties that the other From games offer so I haven't played it since Elden Ring dropped. This is 100% my opinion and not to be taken objectively.

Now coming on to the topic at hand I just wanted to go over a few things and compare them between both the games. I've got about 150 hours in DS3 and 80 in Elden ring midway through NG+ now. This is just my breakdown of each of the main components that are present in these games.

&amp;#x200B;

# Gameplay:

This is the most important thing for a game IMO, If it's got perfect everything but shit gameplay, it might as well be a movie. The base gameplay in both these games is pretty similar and I like it but ER takes a lead here because it just has more to it. Torrent and the ability to jump (*in a useful way*) add a lot to the gameplay. It changes the combat a lot along with the ability to crouch and also the exploration as this opens up better platforming opportunities which are well utilized as well. Honestly, the gameplay is pretty smooth in both games with smooth animations and the only problem I have would be that enemies can corner you into a wall and just not allow you to move at all which at that point is just death. 

&amp;#x200B;

# World and Visuals:

Being open world, this is naturally a primary focus of ER and it shows. I used to be surprised to find others saying the world of DS3 was bland and boring, and although I still feel it's one of the best worlds I've experienced in a video game ER just blows it out of the water. There's no comparison. The few areas in DS3 that I'd consider fun to go through would be the Cathedral, Irithyll, and Lothric castle with the Archives(*Main game only*). 

ER on the other hand has about the same amount of areas that I'd consider bad as I loved in DS3. Places like Leyndell, Raya Lucaria, Stormveil, Nokron, etc are just amazing experiences and are picturesque to look at. Combined with the jump, ER also takes  W in this department.

&amp;#x200B;

# Combat:

Both the games are pretty much the same in combat with a key few differences. Ashes of war make weapon arts more accessible and customizable, summons are honestly a genius change as it basically allows you to choose your own difficulty but in a natural way. It's obvious that Spells got the focus here as pure melee while still good just doesn't feel the same as it did in DS3. Mind you I used the Farron Greatsword for most of the game so my perception might be slightly skewed. DS3 is the opposite here as magic is underwhelming compared to melee but a mix of both works great in both games. In terms of combat even though ER added a few new things and most of the weapons are cooler I'd still say they're both pretty close and feel tight.

&amp;#x200B;

# Enemies:

Elden ring has a LOT of enemies. About double as much as DS3 from what I saw in a previous post. However, this doesn't mean that it makes ER twice as good. Addressing the elephant in the room, yes, there are a bunch of reskins but I don't mind them. They're just different enough that I won't notice unless I try to look out for them. Another problem is that as there are twice as many enemies here, there are twice as many bad ones as well. Dogs carry over but now there are big dogs. All small flying enemies are just hell to deal with pure melee and those spider revenant things are genuinely probable one of the worst enemies I've ever seen. In terms of how much I hate them, I'd consider them even worse than the ones in Archdragon Peak in DS3. There is also the problem of the game being heavily frontloaded. Most new enemies you encounter in the game within the first half. By the time I finished Leyndell there were maybe around 10 new enemies I encountered after that point. 

DS3 has nowhere near the number of enemies but they're pretty well spaced out so you never feel like you're repeating anything. The only exception here is Lothric Castle where you don't encounter pretty much any new enemies but I'd give it a pass as both this and the High wall are just the same general area and the enemies are used in a lot more creative if not annoying ways.

&amp;#x200B;

# Bosses: 

I don't think both of these games should be Judged massively on just bosses objectively but for me personally, bosses are my main reason to play souls like. ER, DS3, and Hollow Knight are all games where I loved a lot of aspects of the game but they all feel like they're flowing toward the area boss. Sort of like everything in a particular region in these games, the weapons, enemies, challenges all lead up to this. The boss fight. Therefore, I personally find them the most enjoyable parts of these games. 

I'm sorry to say but of the three games listed above, ER is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong I do still love some bosses. Morgott is my personal favorite. I loved Radahn in all but the gameplay, the same goes with pretty much all others too. They're amazingly designed bosses in all but the gameplay aspect of it. In terms of animations, Visuals, and the presentation in general, it's got both HK and DS3 beat but I just enjoy fighting the bosses more in those games. This comes down to one thing, one-shot moves (*Keep in mind I beat some of the bosses before the update so Idk if anything's been changed about them*). It's just not fun to go through the whole fight perfectly and get one shot by a move. You can say, just level Vigor but I don't think any of the other souls games force you to level Vig as much as 40 just to withstand not being 2 hit, and even despite that a few of the bosses like Radahn have one shot almost unavoidable moves (*like the four gravity rocks*) that just suck the enjoyment out of it. 

This is where the spirit summons come in, there are good summons and bad summons. The good ones make some of the bosses too easy and I just don't have the incentive to level bad ones. I felt bad for cheesing Margit so I decided I won't summon unless I need to. I did it with Renalla because of her summons, Radahn has built-in summons and It's just an otherworldly experience fighting alongside so many NPCs. Other than this, I summoned for mini-bosses who I couldn't be bothered to fight or reskins like the Godskin gang.  I also summoned for Malenia and the final bosses as they just felt bs at points. I feel like I was over-leveled so I didn't have trouble with any other fight I did without summons (*Like Maliketh, lots of people were frustrated with that one*) except for Horah Loux. I hated but also loved that fight, it was brutally tough and annoying but fair In my opinion (*as long as you have enough vigor*) But I won't say there was any fight mechanically other than Godrick, Godfrey, and Morgott that I loved.

DS3 in my opinion has one of the best boss rosters in any game I've played \[*HK too, you should try it if you haven't*  ;-) \]. There are some mediocre bosses in the game but they are all easy af so you just kinda forget about them. Every single tough/difficult boss in this game IMO(*main game only*) is well made and a fair fight. Abyss Watchers, Pontiff Sulyvahn, Dancer of the Boreal Valley, Champion Gundyr, Nameless King, Dragonslayer Armor, Twin Princes, and Soul of Cinder. Even saying their names makes me wanna fight them again. They might not have looked as good as the ones we have in ER but they felt much more in my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

# Music: 

I'll keep this short as I'm not really a music guy but ER comes on top in terms of overworld music simply because it has overworld music at all. In terms of Boss Osts though I just feel like there aren't very many memorable ones that I can hum at any time I want. Radahn and Godskin gang are the only ones that come to mind immediately but I'm sure there are others just as good if not better like Malenia maybe.

All good bosses in DS3 have good music. However, occasionally some bad bosses get good music too. Can't say much more without having to go in-depth into each track.

&amp;#x200B;

# Lore:

I'd say this is much more up to personal interpretation than the other things mentioned above so I won't talk much about it. However, purely in terms of how the lore is presented and given to you, ER wins hands down. A lot of the cool stuff you hear about in lore, you can see in trailers and cinematics/cutscenes. I'll also add that a lot of the lore is tied to the main story which I also appreciate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll conclude by saying that this is completely my personal opinion and not to be taken as me speaking objectively. I'd also appreciate feedback and for others to share their opinions as well. Thanks for reading  :)."

Eldenring,thedoctorisin7863,Elden Ring Prop Hunt?,"The Mimic Veil got me thinking that an organized prop hunt would be incredibly fun with a group password.

the rules would be as follows.

The Host would choose a legacy dungeon and clear it of enemies. acceptable dungeons would be (Castle Morne, Stormveil Castle, Raya Lucaria Academy, Redmane Castle, Caria Manor, Shaded Castle, Prison Town, Castle Sol, and Nokstella Eternal City). areas like Siofra River, Mohgwym Palace, and the lake part of deeproot depths have some really great areas for prop hunt but they do need some agreed upon restrictions due to size, 

the host would then choose a site of grace that is somewhere near the middle of the legacy dungeon so the props don't have to run that far to hide.

The props are not allowed to hide outside of the legacy dungeon (or the agreed upon boundaries), nor are they allowed to attack the invader or heal, all flask charges will be convered to cerulean. if a prop get discovered, it's allowed to run away and potentially lose the invader. props are also allowed to move around and activate the mimic veil as many times as they want. but they cannot attack the invader. they would also all have to wear the same armor.

the invader would have to use a weapon that doesn't kill a prop in 1-hit, somewhere around 4-10 hits would be good. the invader is not allowed to use lock-on, and must give props 1-3 minutes to hide. the invader has 5-8 minutes to find the props. 

(I also realize that it might be a bit of a hassle if the host is killed and has to clear the area out every time, so the host could use the crimson bubbletear and be truthful if it activates.)"

I tried entering failsafe mode but the console turned itself of before i got that far.  I tried different cables and outlets but no luck. 

After speaking to Sony support they told me to send it in and so i did. Now two weeks later i finally got a return ps5, not the one i sent in but propably another refurbished console. I set it up and finally i was back in the game. I beat godrick and continued playing for about 2 more hours, then the game crashed and the console turned off, now i got the same problem again. Ps5 won't turn on and i have to send it in again. It's hard to believe that i would get two bad consoles by chanse, so i started wondering if Elden Ring has anything to do with it?

Eldenring,Lobselvith,"Will we get new types of magic, ""rumor"" discussion ""possible spoilers""","Guessing we will get a level 1 character to choose like all souls games,   
I love starting at level 1 and building a character,   
while going over some lore that we know so far  
I had a thought about the different Kingdoms in Elden Ring, there must be some new types of magic compared to past souls games and each of the Kingdoms in the game has its own unique types of magic?  
maybe we will get some new and interesting dark magic, and arcane, pyromancy, and faith types of spells, but I want to know about the 5th type of spells. or maybe 6th.  


maybe The Golden Order had its own school of magic? neither faith, arcane ""[**Sorceries**](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Sorceries)**""**, dark, or pyromancy?  


water-based magic, wind magic? ice would be nice we saw some magic in dark souls 3 that was ice-based but they made that part of the arcane ""[**Sorceries**](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Sorceries)**""  ""**  
maybe the cube for summoning can be counted as a magic type? and we can summon some skeletons almost like being a necromancer?  


if we do get a new magic type what would you like to see?"

Eldenring,KnightWarlock,A game the Manga CLAYMORE made by FROM SOFTWARE is planned for 2024/25 and is going full development after ELDEN RING release,"

From Software next game is an original Claymore game adaptation.

It will be more like Sekiro, with a voiced female protagonist and linear storytelling. The publisher is probably going to be Bandai.

The story will be original and redone under Myiazaki liking but will respect original designs and some of the LORE. It won't be connected to neither anime or manga.

The game is planned for 2024/25 and is going full development after ER release.

So you are think is real or fake

Eldenring,dgmdavid,Elden Ring already influencing mobile games,
Eldenring,Duke_Downing,I keep calling her Merlina...,
Eldenring,Duke_Downing,The Moonlight Greatsword (and the moon phases),"This is just more of a fan idea of mine. But how cool would it be the Moonlight Greatsword (if there is one in ER) changes based on the different phases of the moon during the day/night cycles? During the day, it's more a catalyst, casting it's spell at low fp and at low damage, along with one or two other spells, again weaker forms due to the moon not being present. And when ever it is night, that's when its the strong form. Full moon obviously would be the strongest form, as the Greatsword, whilst the weapon would change during other phases. Like a Katana during a crescent phase, an Axe during gibbous phases, and a Straight Sword during either of the half-phases (since it would be half the sword of a greatsword idk).

The main weapon art would also change with each phase. With the Katana, it would send a vertical crescent through a long range with a slight damage drawback. The axe would strike the ground, doing more of an aoe earthquake effect, with short range but high damage. And both sword types would do the same and cut down the middle for medium range and damage, just the regular sword would be half the damage and range."

Lucky lunch + burglar’s ring + two lucky rings (combined with the burglar’s ring and preferably like... an iridium band. I only have one lucky ring sadly but when I get another one...) + monster musk. 

Level 40-80 of the mines. 

It’s so freaking dumb. You get tons of slimes and bars that will spawn to more than make up for the material cost, the dust sprites become so plentiful and can drop 3-4 coal *each*, the occasional ghosts drop a nice amount of solar essence... and because you have both enhanced luck and monster spawning it makes finding the staircase down *easy*. And then you just pick off any gem or iron nodes and you’ve got a supply of those too. 

I’d you’re like me and have permanent access to blue jazz seeds (and in a position to grow about 30 at a time on almost a whim) and a sea cucumber fish pond and a permanent corn plant in the greenhouse that also becomes basically free.

StardewValley,AcceptableBee3,What are your SDV tips and tricks you think other players might not know?,"I'll go first. Maybe both of these are common knowledge, but I figured them out through trial and error.

1. If you're in any of the caves, and you're not sure if what you're about to hit is a rock or a rock crab (or iridium crab, magma crab, whatever), wave your sword over it. If it's a crab, a zero will appear above it. So then you can decide if you want to smack it or just avoid that particular ""rock"".
2. If you accidentally plow a spot, or just want to change your layout but the plowed spots are getting in the way, you don't have to wait for it to ""wear off"". Just hit it with the pickaxe, and it will immediately go back to normal ground.

So, yesterday I wanted to start playing Stardew Valley again. Then I thought to myself ""Hey, you played this quite a bit already, why not check out some mods?""

So I installed Stardew Valley Expanded, and the IF2R map. However, I quickly noticed a very annoying problem: After a few minutes of playing, the game just randomly resets, i.e., I just get back to the title screen again (with the concerned ape logo), and obviously it didn't save.

Then I thought, maybe the issue lies with SVE. I actually just want a different farm layout, so maybe it works with _just_ IF2R. But nope, same issue.

This is a real bummer as I would love to try out a new layout, but this just makes the game unplayable. It doesn't happen on vanilla. Does anyone have an idea what's going on? I'm playing on Windows."

StardewValley,Brassica_Revolution,Hi! A mod newbie needs your help,"Hello everyone,

I'm trying to get Stardew Valley Expanded running, which is also my first mod ever I'm trying (not a great idea in retrospect). I've posted my problem yesterday to r/StardewValleyExpanded and nobody could help me, so I'm asking here in hopes of more people seeing it. I have an award (one of the free ones, sorry it's not more) waiting for the person who helps me.

What I posted yesterday:

&gt;Here's the SMAPI log: [https://smapi.io/log/08b0684fba47463bba866d99db82f4fc](https://smapi.io/log/08b0684fba47463bba866d99db82f4fc)  
&gt;  
&gt;As  you can see, it skips certain mods because it can't find the  manifest.json file. Whenever I start a new save file, everything looks  like vanilla Stardew, so I fear it blocks the mod altogether.  
&gt;  
&gt;I've traced this back as good as I can and [here](https://github.com/FlashShifter/StardewValleyExpanded/wiki/Troubleshooting)  it explains: ""This is the result of incorrectly installing SVE.  Double-check the  install guide and compare how your Mods folder looks  to the screenshots.""  
&gt;  
&gt;I've followed the [install guide](https://github.com/FlashShifter/StardewValleyExpanded/wiki/Install-guide) closely, but here's the problem: I have no idea where the folders called **ConsoleCommands**, **ErrorHandler** and **SaveBackup**  come from. They are not among the other mod folders I installed, but in  the install guide they appear in screenshots. I have no idea how to get  them. I suspect that these missing folders are the reason the mods  don't work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Is anyone familiar with the problem or knows how to fix this?  
&gt;  
&gt;Please remember that I am VERY new to modding and just doing my first baby steps, so thanks for being patient with me!  
&gt;  
&gt;Also,  how will I be able to tell that it worked? Right now I am starting a  new save file everytime (as recommended) and walk around the farm to see  if the layout changed (I've also installed Grandpa's Farm). Is there a  faster way to check this? I didn't want to research the changed content  too much for fear of spoilers.

I'd really, really appreciate it if someone could lend me a hand, because by now I'm pretty desperate. Today (after regaining some patience and nerves) I deleted and reinstalled all the mods again and it didn't change anything.

Thank you in advance!"

StardewValley,GeosAlt,What crop should I plant for summer?,"I started playing today, my first summer just started. I didn't knew that just after 28 days season would end. (I was expecting it to be 3 month long).. I added fertilizers to every farmland on 28th day. The next day all crops were dead and more than 300 stone was wasted. Luckily I has some strawberry harvest on the last day and currently have 3192 gold. I wanted to upgrade my axe to copper, but now that I have to replant crops, I think it would be better to purchase seeds first. What crops should I purchase for the summer?

StardewValley,giftfrom,Big Barn vs Deluxe Barn questions,"Are the insides of the Big Barn and the Deluxe Barn exactly the same? I tried looking up pictures but can't find out. Just the Deluxe Barn has an auto feeder that refills the trough with hay each day? (I assume this isn't free hay either right, just it taking it out for you?)

I told Robin to upgrade my Big Barn to a Deluxe Barn and I lost track of how long she had been working on it. Then I noticed she was gone but I thought my barn hadn't been upgraded. It looks the same (I think) and the trough wasn't longer like when it went from 4 to 8 long from Normal Barn to Big Barn. I think it said I can fit 12 animals in a Deluxe Barn so I was expecting it to increase the trough to 12 spaces. How would 12 animals eat hay if there's only 8 spaces for hay?

I also thought my cows had stopped eating hay for the past few days as I kept seeing the trough full of hay each day, yet they were happy and still producing milk. My chicken coop still needed to be filled with hay each day so I was confused. Then I just realized that it probably was upgraded to a Deluxe Barn with the auto feeder and that was what was happening. 

Just confused about if it looks identical to a Big Barn and about the trough only having 8 spaces if you can have 12 animals. Ty for any help!"

StardewValley,Algea83,Caroline asked a good question today.,"Today when I went to Willy's to sell him my fresh iridium catch, I met Caroline and she said that it was her time off. Then she asked whether I ever had a time off, too. And when I thought about it, I couldn't say I ever did. Like all my days at the farm are packed with stuff to do: watering my crops, catching fish, cutting trees, or mining. And when it's after dark and I have no more energy left, I visit the saloon, talk with people there, and then do a foraging run if there's any time left.

What is even a day off in the game? I try to play chill, but I always end up maximising efficiency. How do you go about it?"
StardewValley,SlimyFarmer,Shane = Lewis's Son?,"(Okay, please tell me this is crazy!) So I had a thought: what if Shane is Lewis's son? 

I've always thought it was strange that Lewis &amp; Marnie were so secretive about their relationship. But I was looking through the list of villager likes &amp; dislikes and noticed some similarities between Lewis &amp; Shane:

* Both love hot peppers
* Both hate quartz
* Both have relatively similar feelings on forgeable
* (Note that this is as far as Demetrius &amp; Maru's similar tastes go &amp; much further than most parent-child similarities go) 

On top of that, both have a rounded tip to their nose that is pretty unique among Stardew Villagers - and not one that Marnie shares (and they have similar skin tones but so do a ton of other villagers so that's kinda meh). 

We don't know anything about Shane's parents except that one of them is Marnie's sibling. So my theory is as follows: 

* Lewis had a relationship with Marnie's sister. Probably a very secret affair.
* Said sister gives birth to Shane &amp; moves out of Stardew (either before or after giving birth to Shane). 
* Sister dies later, probably when Shane is an adult. Before her death, Shane is made aware of his father (aka Lewis). 
* Sometime in the intervening time, Lewis starts an affair with Marnie.
* Shane moves in with Marnie after he assumes parenting roles of Jas. 

This leaves Shane &amp; Lewis in a position of holding a big secret. Perhaps Shane is drinking to try and forget what a terrible father he has &amp; how this father is now sleeping with his aunt. Perhaps Lewis wants to keep the relationship with Marnie a secret because he knows that his relationship to Shane could be made pubic &amp; he doesn't want to let both of those facts (fathering Shane &amp; sleeping with Marnie) to be both known. The bigger question: does Marnie know? 

Again, feel free to tell me I'm crazy or that I missed some background but it doesn't NOT make sense!"

StardewValley,grandweapon,I may have stumbled upon another potential fix for the mummified bat bug on Switch,"Like many other Switch players, I have been struggling with finding the mummified bat. I've tried everything suggested, including accepting Qi's Crops quest, going on a super lucky day, eating food with luck buffs, etc. After a few seasons of bombing the crap out of the volcano, I more or less gave up on finding it.

Today, I finally went back into the volcano after ignoring it for several seasons. I wasn't expecting much and did not even check the TV for the daily luck. I ate a spicy eel on the way in, and started bombing level 1 of the volcano. 4 bombs in, I found 2 mummified bats! I thought it must be a super luck day, so I went back home and checked the TV. Guess what? ""The spirits are very displeased today."" So I somehow managed to find 2 bats almost instantly on a super unlucky day with just a spicy eel (+1 luck)!

What changed? What did I do differently this time? And then it hit me. I recently changed my mining professions from Miner/Prospector to Geologist/Gemologist. Could it be that the increased drop rate of ore and coal with the Miner profession screwed with the drop rate of the mummified bat? Gemologist only affects the drop rate of gem nodes and not other rocks.

I would love to know if this was the issue. If you are struggling to find the mummified bat and have the Miner profession, try switching to Geologist and see if it works!"

I currently have a save file that I just started where my plan is to only fish. The only skill I gain is in fishing as sort of a self imposed challenge.

StardewValley,HighlanderOneTrick,Maximizing profit tips going year 2 and beyond?,"Roughly what I understand of stardew turbo minmax late game is turning your farm into an industrialized brewery, centering around processing your crops rather than selling them directly. However what I want to know are the ""breakpoints"". For instance, at my point I have way too many hops stacking up just from my greenhouse alone that my kegs can't keep up, and yet I also have a lot of fruit and high value veggies (like pumpkins) that would loved to be kegged too, not to mention my casks that straight up aren't being worked because I don't have high value wines to age. Obviously literally every crop in the game is better processed in some form, but my question is when do you sell, what do you sell, what takes priority on what machines, that sort of thing. For starters, I've heard artichokes are great for your second spring, so I'll be planting that, and I also want to keep some ""giant crop"" crops around for processing, but high value crops want the keg and I'm always short. 

tl;dr, I'm looking for general ""rule of thumb"" tips when it comes to choosing what goes where."

- “I just spent 4,000 on the coop what do you mean you’ll start working on it tomorrow?!”
- “I know you said to save the grass but I’ll buy grass starters later in the game.”

- *also after completing the first bundle* “Wait. There’s more boxes? Wtf!”

I've been playing Stardew Valley on PC for years but it's been a while since I've played because I work DIDO (Drive in drive out) and have stopped bringing my laptop with me because it's too bulky. I recently bought a Switch to keep me entertained. I definitely prefer a mouse and keyboard, and I haven't bought Stardew Valley on the switch yet because I think the controls would annoy me and it would just go to waste...

Have any of you fans played on both? I'd like to know how the two platforms compare with eachother in gameplay for SV."

StardewValley,michaelochurch,"Perfection in Year Two, Achieved: Thoughts, Stats, and Pitfalls","&amp;#x200B;

[Mr. Qi doesn't seem to want the Shrimp Cocktail I cooked for him \(Winter 28, Year II; 100&amp;#37; achieved\).](https://preview.redd.it/ym1nchaqnwp71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81bf07cfdf0d7a374a3922609d71b11b4e275d89)

Some comments on the playthrough/route:

* With one exception, I stuck to casual strats (e.g., no RNG manipulation) and avoided resets. The one time I ""cheated"" was during the Prismatic Slime quest; I was getting terrible RNG, and on the last day I used Stardew Predictor to find a infested floor (Slimes) in the Mines. This was *probably* immaterial to the success of the run; I had 3 weeks to spare.
* ""Effective completion"" was attained by Winter 7 of Year II (203 days). By ""effective completion"", I mean that I had everything achieved except the last two recipes (which aren't available until later), and had the ingredients for those recipes. Winter 28 of that year is the earliest possible date for total completion.
* Interestingly, I finished most of the Perfection subtasks around the same time. I killed the last Fire Spirit (Monster Eradication goals) on Winter 1 of Year II. I maxed out Friendship on Winter 2 (after weeks of spamming Salads and movie tickets, along with one Qi's Kindness). I completed the Crafting collection on Winter 5, completed the Museum (last Artifact: Prehistoric Handaxe) and finished Cooking (minus 3) on Winter 6, and bought the Gold Clock on Winter 7. It wasn't planned that way; that was just how it fell together.
* The run took 87 hours and 43 minutes (speed was not a target of the run) plus a few hours of planning. I did 41 board quests (Help Wanted, Special Orders). My maximum Skull Cavern depth was an unimpressive 108; I did not use Skull Cavern as my main moneymaker. My total earnings was 20,778,720g.
* My most-shipped crop was Blueberry (3217). My final Keg count was 720.
* I actually had a lousy first 12 days. and considered restarting. Because of a few early mistakes, I was only able to afford 97 Strawberries on Spring 13 of Year I and was far behind on money goals throughout Year I... but I did really well that Winter (Crystal Fruit Wine) and was able to recover.
* I waited until Year II (early Spring) to complete the Community Center, in order to get +500 Friendship with Kent. This was a mistake. It didn't kill the run, but unlocking Ginger Island a season later meant that I was more exposed to RNG later in Year II.
* I believe my route is repeatable with success probability over 99% by players of average fishing and mining skill, assuming they've played Stardew Valley before.

Some pitfalls on Year Two Perfection challenges (**spoilers ahead**, obviously):

* **Clone your first Marble** in a Crystalarium. Marble is a mineral you need for a crafting recipe, and it's not that rare, but forgetting to do this can leave you very RNG-exposed toward the end of the run.
* Choose **mushrooms** when Demetrius offers to improve your Cave (mid-Spring). Morels are extremely rare through other means: they spawn only in the Secret Woods during Spring, nowhere else, and you need 3 to complete Perfection (one to ship, one to cook, one to craft the Elixir). Even if you check every day during Year II Spring, there's about a 1.3% chance that you don't get enough-- and this will kill the run.
* **Be careful with your Ginger Island Farm.** Do, however, clear it as soon as you unlock it, and unlock it as soon as you can. You need to do some Ginger Island farming (Walnuts) but there's a 1.5 artifact (Snake Vertebrae, of which you need two) that spawns only on Ginger Island West. Filling up your Island farm reduces the probability of getting it. (This is also why you want to clear it and keep it clear-- maximize the chance of spawning.) I designed my route not to rely on the Ginger Island farm, though I managed to get the Snake Vertebrae reasonably early (mid-Fall of Year II). Once you have those items, farm away.
* Visit **Ginger Island often to check on Gus**. One of the recipes (Tropical Curry) is only available when Gus goes to the Island, which isn't often (perhaps 10% per day). You may have to check every day for more than a season (or save-scum). 
* When Mr. Qi offers **""Danger in the Deep"" or ""Skull Cavern Invasion""**, take it. Prefer the former. You need to do one or the other  to get any Radioactive Ore. Danger in the Deep is better because it gives you the ability to set the Mines to the ""Difficult"" version (and get more Radioactive Ore).
* **Mr. Qi's late-game items** aren't just vanity; they can **correct mistakes**. You will probably sell something you didn't mean to sell, or lose a crop to a crow, or something like that. Magic Bait saved my ass because I forgot to keep a Sunfish. The Deconstructor is good if you get lousy RNG re: Radioactive Ore, because you can recycle them. Pierre's Missing Stocklist costs 50 Qi Gems, but if you forget one crop (Spring and Summer of Year II are very busy) you will need it. You need 140 Qi Gems at a minimum to complete the game; 190 if you end up needing the Stocklist. This is achievable if you unlock his special room by late Summer. I would **not** advise upgrading your weapon (120 Qi Gems!) unless you're absolutely sure you can afford it-- regular Galaxy Sword + 3 Rubies is more than enough for the entire game.
* **Save 25 Strawberries at the end of Year I Spring**. Late in Year I, use **Seed Makers** and the Greenhouse. You want 600 Seeds going into Spring of Year II. I think they're actually more important than Ancient Seeds, because they give you money that'll be available for your mid-Spring Rhubarb (Wine) purchase and your Summer Starfruit buys.
* On **Ancient Seeds**: they're a decent crop, and you should get at least one as early as you can (kill Grubs around Floor 20-30, and you should have your first in Year I Spring) but **I designed my route not to rely on them**. Starfruit + Deluxe Speed Grow give better g/day if you're making Wine, and Strawberries provide much faster return in the critical Year II Spring, when you're trying to amass enough money for \~4200 Starfruit Seeds. I used Ancient Seed jelly for my late-game walking-around money while amassing Starfruit Wine for my win condition.
* Buy **lots of Wood on/before Winter 28 of Year I.** You will need it for Kegs; the price goes up 5x in Year II, and the best Spring crops don't cost anything (except time and Seed Makers).
* Always keep in mind the **time value of money**. The ""discount rate"" at a 2-year pace is approximately 3.3% per day. For example, this means that Crystalariums aren't profitable cash generators; they cost 5,573g (Blacksmith) to generate no more than 150g per day (a 4,500g) cash flow. That doesn't mean Crystalariums are useless, of course. They make Jades (Staircase) and Rubies (Spicy Eel) and Diamonds (a loved gift). They're just lousy as money machines.

If there are questions about my route or Stardew Valley strategy more generally, I'll do my best to answer. I believe (as my route indicates) Year Two perfection is well within the reach of mid- to upper-tier casual players; you don't have to be fantastic at this game or a speedrunner (I'm neither) to pull it off."

It is such a low drop rate, and it only shows up in artifact spots for the Backwoods and the Beach.  It can be harvested from bone nodes but at some crazy low chance, like 0.8%, and the monsters it can drop from I have no idea how to find.

Does anyone have advice???  I’m so frustrated because I thought I had finished it after a different artifact and found that this was the only one actually remaining."

Also I didn't unlocked the key to the sewers yet, so I can't buy the 10 daily Solar Essences from the little black guy.

Right now I can only make 30 Mega Bombs. If the mummy's drop it frequently I might use them next time I can, but first I wanted the opinion of you advanced players :-)

As such, I'm looking to scale back from cash crops/CC bundles into something more relaxed. So I want to ask, what are your favorite ""just because"" crops/produce?

I like brewing crystal fruit wine, because I feel it's just plain classy. I have a few dozen ready to be laid up once I can afford a cellar, which I intend to age out iridium quality--alongside some nice beers and pale ales--as a special ""brewers reserve"". Those are gonna go to townsfolk as gifts, and whatever is left over to Pierre's shop.

By now I can almost dream the first two levels, but I keep dying at the gem sea giant level. Damn those bubbles. Level 1 and 2 were hard too at first, but with practice I got a little better. The gem sea giant just seems like random luck to me, which I apparently don't have. Is there any skill involved or do I somehow have to increase my real life luck?"

StardewValley,geekgirl717,Willy and Gus,"I feel like these two guys just don’t get enough love.

Gus is a nice guy.  He never has anything bad to say AND he tries to watch out for Pam and Linus.

Willy teaches you to fish—I mean he makes teaching you and giving you equipment a priority.

I know neither one is eligible for marriage, but I feel like they get overlooked as characters a lot.

I love fishing on the dock next to Willy and wish there was a bit more to Gus than just the bar."
StardewValley,drivenmadnow,Crops and their advantages I'm figuring out,"Hops: Multi harvest. Probably the fastest re-growing multi harvest crop. Can be used to make Pale Ale when aged has a pretty good yield. Only problem is you can't walk through it so there's only so much you can set up in the greenhouse around sprinklers. The fertilizer I suggest is Deluxe Fast Gro because you're going to turn it into Pale Ale anyway, high quality crops isn't important.

Cranberries: Multi harvest. Offers 2 cranberries or more (by a certain chance) per harvest. Each cranberry is worth more than blueberry. Can walk through. I suggest Deluxe Fast Gro fertilizer since it sells more as wine.

Corn: Multi harvest. Can be grown outside from summer to fall and since it's a multi harvest you can keep growing from summer to fall without having to hack it away and re-plant a new crop. I suggest Deluxe Fast Gro. 

Ancient Fruit: Multi harvest. Arguably the best crop in my opinion. Yields very high prices per harvest when turned into aged wine. Only proceeded by Starfruit and Sweet Gem Berry. But those aren't multi harvests and you have to buy the expensive seeds again. Deluxe Fast Gro to make it into wine.

Starfruit: Not multi harvest but has the highest yield when turned into aged wine. Deluxe Fast Gro. Quality of fruit alone isn't important unless you want to sell as it is.

Sweet Gem Berry: Not multi harvest but has the highest profit per harvest when sold as it is. Unlike other crops it should get the quality fertilizer since you won't be turning it into any artisan items and just want the highest quality of the crop alone. 

Pumpkins: Cannot pass. Has the highest yield among the giant crops. Can be a giant crop. Cannot be turned into wine though.

Melon: Giant crop possibility. Can be turned into wine so has potential to be sold for more than Pumpkins."

I am so confused, I went on a run to the skull cavern because I have a ""schedule"" where I go every Sunday with my jades and than also go to the skull cavern (with items I already have in a chest) I didn't have many staircases around like 30 max and it wasn't a lucky day, I just started farming up stuff I got really lucky and got to lvl 100+ again I got the blue cowboy hat and I am pretty sure that after I went past lvl 100+ I just got my first prismatic shard! I was so excited I took 2 screenshots and moved on (btw the run isn't as efficient since I didn't use a totem I went to the bus so I got there at like 11AM) anyways after that around time I put a couple of bombs and ran away I got more and more of the prismatic shards! at the end I somehow got 5!!!! I don't know what to do with them but I know I can use them for weapons! I would appreciate if someone could explain without spoilers, I am 1 bundle away from finishing CC (wizard bundle) anyways I will put the screenshot I took before going back to my house (I know that I can just stay there until 2AM and it's most of the time worth it but I didn't wanna risk the prismatic shards, also I got like 220 Iridium xD)

StardewValley,passerby-squirrel,Forest Farm Question,"So I'm planning to do my second run of Stardew Valley on the Forest Farm, and I heard that you can forage mushrooms on the Forest Farm. General consensus seems to be that mushrooms are better than fruit bats for the Farm Cave, but if you play the Forest Farm, should you take the fruit bats instead since mushrooms are available through foraging? Or are mushrooms still better due to low mushroom spawn rate or something? I plan to eventually take the Botanist profession too if that makes any difference."
StardewValley,ArtByIthil,How much does it cost to complete the community center?,Has anybody calculated the full cost of completing the community center? I am wondering how much gold actually goes into completing all of the bundles and not necessarily just the value of all of the items included in the bundles but for instance the cost of buying a coop and upgrading it then purchasing chickens a duck and rabbit as well as buying a silo to fill with hay to feed them all so that you can get a duck feather a rabbit foot and a few chicken eggs for bundles.  The cost of upgrading your house so that you can have a kitchen in order to make a fried egg or the maki roll unless you buy those from the traveling cart in which case however much they cost.  I am genuinely interested to know how much it costs to complete the bundles and I am also wondering how much it costs compared to going the Joja membership route.

StardewValley,illusion17,Penny's 2 heart scene really hurt my opinion of her character design.,"I'll preface this with that I'm not a huge penny fan to begin with. For one I'm not into girls so I have no romantic interest in her to begin with, but her character has always rubbed me the wrong way. Her two heart scene really cemented what it is about her character I dislike so much. 

Though I'm not familiar with her romance line, most of the romanceable characters seem to have some sort of problem or character flaw they work through. My guess would be that Penny has to work through trauma relating to her upbringing. However, Penny  has a massive character flaw that the game not only seems to ignore, but also seems to encourage and  praise. 

That is that Penny's niceness seems to at times be almost a self defense mechanism caused by her upbringing. The reason that scene bothered me so much is that rather than using it as a character building moment for her by telling her that sometimes kind intentions  fail  to truly show empathy for the other person, the game doubles down with Penny acting like a kicked puppy and the game acting like she did nothing wrong. Don't get me wrong, George over reacted, but Penny's actions were incredibly rude even if they were intended to be kind. But when you call her out for not asking him first, not only does the game defend her, but you also lose hearts with her. 

So I realized after seeing this scene for the first time that the reason that Penny has always rubbed me the wrong way is that she's set up as a deeply flawed character who needs to work through her problems, but never works through said problems. It almost treats her as though she's perfect even though it sets her up  as a traumatized person who needs help working through her problems. So you pretty much have this character in desperate need of emotional support, but every scene with her is just the game trying to paint her as perfect. Penny loving animals, Penny helping the disabled, Penny teaching children. Rather than focusing on the deeper aspects of her character, it just seems to spend all of her dialogue reinforcing the surface level stuff. 

Well whatever lol. I can definitely see why so many people like  her considering she's  portrayed as incredibly  cute,  kind,  and intelligent, but I just wish they would portray  her flaws more often instead of  her being perfect."

…Well it didn’t go like that. Linus was upset that I was attempting to take him away from his home and I felt horrible. He got really sad but said he appreciated the thought, but he loved where he stayed. God I feel horrible.

Then I head outside and go straight to the barns/coops and pet each animal, grab stuff from the auto harvester and throw it in the respective cheese/truffle oil/mayo/cloth maker machines, then hop on my horse and water and pet the cat, go to the cave to harvest the mushrooms, then into the greenhouse to harvest fruit trees/ancient fruits, then to the shed to check the preserve jars and wine makers. after this it’s like 11:30 at least.

I saw the new update even though it came out a while ago, and I wanted to start a new playthrough.

I don't want to play as efficiently as possible and take the fun out of it having all my days planned out, but I also want to maximize profits to an extent and finish the community center in the first year, and hopefully try to complete some of the other challenges on the road to total perfection by year two. I don't have to necessarily complete the game in that time.

I was just wondering, what are your guy's strategies to complete the community center in one year and be able to be really profitable. I took too long of a break and I have since forgotten what are the best crops and things like that, but could never forget how much fun my first 170 hours were on it, here's to 170 more.

StardewValley,salgod420,"a compilation of tricks that well-seasoned players may know by heart, but newer players will appreciate:","  

I’ve been putting together this list since I started the game at the start of last year. feel free to add any others you can think of in the comments!

\- are there fishing bubbles in a spot that looks technically impossible to reach? use WASD/joystick when casting to alter the direction of your fishing line.

\- you can plant grass starters inside sheds/barns/coops. your animals won’t eat it like that, but they still produce hay when cut with a scythe. this means you can still feed your animals hay if they run out/marnie isn’t available. 

\- if you kill every monster on a level in the mines, the chance for rocks to produce a staircase will increase. this can be useful in the early game because hitting rocks costs energy but swinging a sword does not. 

\- hold down right click/’A’ button while planting and harvesting large fields of seeds, its faster than clicking every tile individually. 

\- if you’re broke in the early game after buying seeds, you don’t lose money when passing out because there is no money to lose. 

\- you don’t have to run to see the train passing through the valley. if you’re doing something important, you can go to the tracks later to pick up the resources. 

\- if you have a lot of extra rings/weapons/shoes you don’t use, sell them to the adventurer’s guild instead of throwing them out. Also, rings and shoes can be stored in dressers.

\- when hovering your cursor over items, the gold icon in the top right of your inventory will pulse if that item is needed for the community center. 

\- upgraded shed + garden pots + deluxe retaining soil + replenishing crops = self-sustaining greenhouse.

\- placing items outside of your farm is a risky game. if an NPC walks over it, the item will be gone forever. this applies to foragables, too. there is a page on the wiki that shows all tiles that are safe for placing items if you want to do some decorating in town!

\- if you miss-click which item you are selling to pierre/willy, the item will appear at the bottom of the stock to rebuy for the same price it was sold.

\- chubs have the best energy/gold ratio than any other fish. this means that instead of selling them in the early game, it is much more efficient to use them for food to fish more. 

\- put tappers on oak trees as early as possible.

\- putting crops that do not replenish into a seed maker is more work than it is worth. it may seem like you’re making a better profit, but the time and unpredictable nature of the return can be more of a loss than a win.

\- casks can ONLY be used in the cellar, so after you finish upgrading your house all the way, do not go all out making casks. you can only fit 125 comfortably in the cellar, and 189 total, assuming you break them all to get to the aged items and then replace them again after harvest. the cellar comes with 33."

StardewValley,tenaciousfetus,Fishing change - update or just RNG?,"Hi everyone, I haven't played any SV in about 2 years and decided to start a new game to discover all the cool new content.

However, I've noticed something different to my old playthroughs.

In the past, I used to basically only fish in areas where there were water ripples as that basically guarantees you a bite, and quickly. I'd see  decent amount of ripples in my day to day.

But, since picking the game up again, I've noticed that I barely see any ripples. I'm on Spring 20 and despite visiting the beach, going past the river in town and the lake in cindersap forest, I've only seen these fishing spot ripples a total of 3 times. In the ""old times"" I could get this in a day.

So - do these ripples just appear less now? Does calm water have a higher chance of getting a bite? Or was I just getting good RNG in the past that's coincidentally stopped since the updates?

I've tried googling but can't find much."

StardewValley,Misisme20,"Theory: Abigail has two ""fathers""...let's look at the evidence.","So I have seen this theory pop around so I decided to give it a look and come to my own conclusion as I hope you all do later. The best way to understand the present is to look at the past.

**Evidence: Abigail *Currently* has Purple hair.**

   Purple is a natural hair color in the world of Stardew Valley. Although Abigail's hair isn't naturally purple, the purple hair has stayed longer than normal dye should. This makes the purple hair, connected to Abigail. But where does the connection come from?

Shane:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/0/0c/Shane-Portrait_192px.png/revision/latest?cb=20151218083242

Jas:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/5/55/Jas.png/revision/latest/top-crop/width/360/height/360?cb=20210504153625

Abigail:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/a/aa/Abigail_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20160428165828

Wizard:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/a/a8/Wizard-Portrait_192px.png/revision/latest?cb=20151218084610


  Jas is far to young to have passed on anything to anyone genetically. Shane is one of the older ""candidates"" in the town, making him older than Abigail. However, he doesn't have a wide enough age gap between himself and Abigail, to have passed on his purple hair to her. The only other person who has a wide enough age difference with Abigail and is a man is...the Wizard.

**Evidence: Abigail was born with light Chestnut hair.**
     So now the question, where did Abigail get this ""light chestnut hair"". Chestnut is brown hair with red tones. So let's look at those with Brown hair

Alex:https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/0/04/Alex.png

Harvey:https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/9/95/Harvey.png

Clint:https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/3/31/Clint.png

Demetrius:https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/f/f9/Demetrius.png

Gus:https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/5/52/Gus.png

Leo:https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/1/1d/Leo.png

Willy:https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/8/82/Willy.png

Pierre:https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/7/7e/Pierre.png


Since we know that Caroline is the mother of Abigail, we exclude woman as the ones who could have passed brown hair with red tones. Harvey and Alex are both close (more Alex than Harvey) in age to Abigail (for the same reason Shane is). In addition, neither of them have red tones in their hair. Clint has yellow tones to his brown hair. Demetrius has brown hair but without noticeable red tones. Gus has yellow tones to his brown hair. Leo is younger than Abigail, like Jas, thus couldn't have passed his brown hair to Abigail. In addition, Leo has no red tones to his hair. Willy has solid brown hair, with no obvious red or yellow tones. Pierre is the only person in Pelican Town who has brown hair with red tones, ie chestnut hair. Pierre a wide enough age difference and is a man, making him the only viable candidate. 


**Misc**

   This is an interesting detail because if we notice, every parent and child living in Pelican Town has a biological trait that they got from a parent. Let's use a base example.

Sam: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/d/dc/Sam-Portrait_192px.png/revision/latest?cb=20160306051048

Kent:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/c/c9/Kent-Portrait_192px.png/revision/latest?cb=20160308100606

Jodi:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/7/7b/Jodi-Portrait_192px.png/revision/latest?cb=20151218080354

Vincent:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/2/2d/Vincent-Portrait_192px.png/revision/latest?cb=20151217141209

Pam:https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/d/da/Pam.png

  If we wanted to know who the parent of Sam was, all we have to do is look for a person who has a wide age difference with Sam and has blonde hair. Kent and Pam are the only ones who have a wide age difference with Sam, while also having blonde hair. To determine between the two, we look at secondary features of Sam. Sam has straight blonde hair. Pam has curly blonde hair and Kent has straight blonde. So the only person who can pass (straight) blonde hair down to Sam, is Kent. Kent's wife, Jodi, has red hair. So we don't have to look far to know who gave Vincent the red hair. 


 Let's apply this to another family.

Robin:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/f/fd/Robin-Portrait_192px.png/revision/latest?cb=20160304204531

Sebastian:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/c/c3/Sebastian-Portrait_192px.png/revision/latest?cb=20160306051229

Maru:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/8/8f/Maru-Portrait_192px.png/revision/latest/top-crop/width/360/height/360?cb=20160306051924

Demetrius:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/stardewvalley/images/3/3e/Demetrius-Portrait_192px.png/revision/latest?cb=20160313191439


     If we wanted to know the parent of Maru, we can look at her skin. Well the only person with dark skin in the game is Demetrius, making him the only viable candidate to have passed those genes onto Maru. Maru has red hair, like Vincent, we don't have to look to far to guess who passed that trait to her...Robin. Unlike the previous family, we have an example of when you can tell that someone *didn't* pass down traits. Sebastian has black hair and white skin. Demetrius has dark skin and brown hair, while his wife Robin has white skin and Red hair. This means that Sebastian can be the son of Robin, but his father (where he got his black hair from) is not Demetrius. [I know we know this but I am explaining it to add consistency].



**Conclusion**: Abigail having both chestnut and purple hair, could have only gotten those hair colors from two people. The Wizard and Pierre. Both are men, making it impossible for both to have passed down the traits at the same time. Caroline is the mother of Abigail, but she has solid green hair. So to question becomes...How can Pierre and the Wizard both have passed down traits at separate times?


**Explanation 1**: Pierre is the Father of Abigail but due to Caroline, while pregnant with Abigail, walking to the Wizard's Tower, some of the Wizard's genetic essence passed to Abigail.

**Explanation 2**: Pierre is the Father of Abigail but due to Abigail walking to the Wizard's Tower, some of the Wizard's genetic essence passed to Abigail.

**Explanation 3**: Pierre is the Father of Abigail and the Wizard is the Grandfather of Abigail.

StardewValley,YikesAWhale,Fixing the Riverland Farm,"So we all know how the riverland layout is one of the worst farms because of its lack of space. 

So one way of maybe buffing it, would be to make crops around the river higher quality. Or something along those lines.

I'm currently playing on the 4 corners farm and I'm trying to figure out how I (eventually) want to lay out my farm. So far [this](https://stardew.info/planner/21-near-greg-played-easily/) is what I'm planning. Anyone have any tips?

StardewValley,theteensaresad,predicting volcano dungeon chests?,i was wondering if there was any way to predict the volcano dungeon chests. whether they will be rare or common and even what’s inside them? i’m looking for one item in particular and if this was a thing it would make my life so much easier.

StardewValley,Mossgrowth,Probably a stupid question about crab pots and a just as stupid question about chickens also clay,"Created a save I am determined not to abandon before summer year 1. 

Are crab pots reusable? I would assume so by Willys price, but cannot guarantee, not sure I want to buy and I am currently unable to craft due to priorities.

Also, can chickens starve to death? Got my chicken coop and two chickens, but I do not have a silo, but I have some purchased hay. Best and quickest ways to get clay? Is there anything faster than just preparing the ground for seeds?"
StardewValley,RepresentativeTop647,How did you enjoy more the game? Using the wiki or not?,"I'm thinking of starting to play again.  And I don't know whether to use the wiki or not.  Tell me your experience, did you enjoy the game more using the wiki or not?  Also now I could play well without using the wiki because I have the basic knowledge, I must say that I don't remember most things so it wouldn't ruin my experience having played with the wiki before.  Thank you"

StardewValley,mischiefyleo,My (20m) husband (28m) relapsed in his drinking problem.,"We’ve been friends for a couple of years, and as I got to know him, he opened up about having a drinking problem. He’s also struggled with some mental issues like depression. I helped support him to quit drinking. We very recently got married, and now I’m finding beer cans by his bed. I’m afraid he’s started drinking again and relapsing. The thing is, once his aunt and I thought he had relapsed before and confronted him about it and he got really upset and defensive with us, it turned out he wasn’t drinking. So I’m a little hesitant to ask him about this now I’m case it’s another misunderstanding. Advice?"
