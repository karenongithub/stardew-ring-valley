Eldenring,mistahARK,"At the same time, if it isn't shown, Geoff has been willfully hyping us up for yet another event with only the thinnest plausible deniability. It's not hard to just not play into it if there's nothing to be hyped about, but of course, that would not benefit SGF numbers üôÉ

**If** it isn't shown, of course."
Eldenring,Beeniemcg,Wait? When is this? I thought it was on sunday?!
Eldenring,mrawesome11234,I planned the post on time and on the dot just 1 more day of hollowing
Eldenring,Ph2seK1ng,"I trust Omni, he teased A LOT about the trailer that will come soon, if not at E3 or SGF, then maybe shadow-drop. But be sure we are getting something before July."
Eldenring,J0n3s3n,"It might not turn into a ""generic fromsoft sub"" because its run by other people"
Eldenring,No_Faithlessness3666,Finally someone does it right!
Eldenring,Ph2seK1ng,"Omni said that what we will get will be worth the wait, indicating (at least to me) that we may get a gameplay that's like 10 minutes long with release date of September 22nd, I would die on the spot."
Eldenring,dfalco4,"I agree, I am hoping for SGF trailer drop, but we always have Bandi's event at E3!  But this time next week comes and there has been no trailer, no news... I think everyone will lose their shit lol"
Eldenring,CantFitItsTooBig,I love me some whores devoured.
Eldenring,Eurotriangle,*furiously subscribes*
Eldenring,Haramzadeyy,Lets fucking gooooooh
Eldenring,enelby,"I mean, for people that don't already have blind faith in FROM games (i.e people that play good games), they have nothing to base the game on. Kinda makes sense. Hopefully tomorrow gives us a fresh dressing of what's to come."
Eldenring,jakrictel,EVERYONE GO RAID THIS INSTAGRAM POLL RIGHT NOW
Eldenring,unjusticeb,Alone live then will watch others reaction
Eldenring,Besmuth,Same
Eldenring,No_Party_8669,I hope Geoff has 20 min dedicated to Elden Ring ;) Trailer and a gameplay demo + Network date and release date!
Eldenring,No_Faithlessness3666,"You mean this?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/lplt56/an\_attempt\_at\_summarizing\_elden\_ring\_subreddit/"
Eldenring,Idunnowhateverrr,Why would it matter? He already dropped the bomb. It'll be a while before the next From/Souls title.
Eldenring,Volkorel,"Ahhh okay, thank you!"
Eldenring,dfalco4,Summer Games Fest!!!
Eldenring,stamwisegamgee,"Summer Game Fest, Keighly has it ^TM"
Eldenring,0pr0phet,"I cannot believe that this is ending... I have been browsing this subreddit for 2 years almost daily. Only we can understand how we feel... Us 240 k tragic things... I will miss this and I will forever remember and cherish the time spent with you all.

I am not crying, you are."
Eldenring,No_Party_8669,Look up Summer Game Fest! Hosted by Keighley
Eldenring,hewasgameboy,"People will bombard you with downvotes in most other subs for this opinion, across the board most enemy designs are worse, they added too much pointless clutter to levels, they changed Boletaria from utalitarian medieval into gothic/victorian. Because the baseline game is great the remake is overall still a fun game to play, it's a terrible remake though, Bluepoint should be ashamed of how smug they got, going into this title as if they're better designers than Fromsoft, news flash almost nobody in the gaming industry can even get close to keeping up with them. They should've added the 6th archstone as optional content and let the creative juices flow there instead of butchering the games art direction, music and voice acting."
Eldenring,youarethedemons79,"Same. My shift starts like an hour before the sgf, I‚Äôm gonna try to stay off the internet till I get home and watch the show then. But we‚Äôll see how long that idea lasts tomorrow‚Ä¶"
Eldenring,Lordanonimmo09,Look at this bunch of wannabe Gwyn.We need to set this sub on fire to a new sub to be born.
Eldenring,NostalgiaCory,Yeah. A hype train
Eldenring,MagnoBurakku,"I mean, there will be Elden Ring 2 and I'm already hollowing for it"
Eldenring,Prune_Terrible,Try battery acid.
Eldenring,Constant-Leather9299,"I think it also depends where you hang out. I see more women in fromsoft fanart circles than in like, super hardcore pvp communities. Most of my female friends IRL played at least one of these games - and liked them, even if they didnt finish them."
Eldenring,SirWetBiscuit,"Get engaged, immediately proceed to ignore SO to play Elden Ring"
Eldenring,xKrolesx,"Don't mind me, just getting the flair, maybe?"
Eldenring,CantFitItsTooBig,"Completely agree. Comparisons are a good thing. But too many people seem to treat comparisons like a boxing match. One has to win and the other has to lose. And because of this a lot of people try to avoid comparisons out of fear that a thing they like will ""lose"". But done right, comparing things is a great way to improve them. Or at the very least, will help inform people on what to spend their time/money on."
Eldenring,Haramzadeyy,That is true i guess. But i've been saving this for over 6 months just for this day. Dont let me down Geoff!
Eldenring,Detoxoonie,Cough
Eldenring,CassiBoi,Same. My plan is to try and avoid the internet until I get home and watch the VOD back so I can experience the heartbreak in real time.
Eldenring,KeewiwiA7X,**It's time.**
Eldenring,Prune_Terrible,"&gt;UBI is good at making open world games, but what about Watchdogs region?

I don't know about that chief. Their open worlds are always mediocre at best."
Eldenring,Lordanonimmo09,"Ubisoft open worlds are pretty dense by standards,but they aren't interesting,they exist solely to give the player a lot of things to do and objectives."
Eldenring,AllMighto,This calls for a crusade!
Eldenring,KeewiwiA7X,The japanese cover art for Dark Souls 1 is so cool...
Eldenring,hornwalker,Only one copy of Bloodborne and Sekiro?? You fool!  You're gonna mess this up.
Eldenring,KeewiwiA7X,Don't worry it will be there I'm making sure
Eldenring,Prune_Terrible,No. 1% is not infinitely larger than 0%. It's 1% larger.
Eldenring,KeewiwiA7X,HOW

Eldenring,majds1," I would love to do that, except i have my final exams right now which sucks cause I won't finish until the 12th. I won't miss sgf though."

Eldenring,mayday5-01,"I would agree with you if the leaked trailers didn‚Äôt exist. We have seen diverse landscapes that even in low quality looked really good. It might be empty at some parts, but that is kind of true for 99.9% of open world games."

Eldenring,Ratchet2332,It‚Äôs been an honor.

Eldenring,Paddy_the_Daddy,"That sounds fucking stupid, I'm sorry"
Eldenring,Kapiteinlulhaas,Would be cool if there are no achievements/trophies locked behind covenant progression this time.
Eldenring,ImmaculateTorus,"after watching this, yeah definitely. Same scenes with a blue hue basically."
Eldenring,TheSpawnofChaos,"While I prefer the Hunter's dream, Majula fits a lot more to a sort of medieval game."

Eldenring,Ideories,i ajree
Eldenring,Caromandk,"Not sure if someone already asked this, but why would this person leak a 6 seconds clip from a video that's obviously more than 1/2 minutes long....???!!!"
Eldenring,Myamdane,I gotta admit I was convinced by this one
Eldenring,Schwiliinker,"I think Doom eternal implemented that actually. I rented it and am waiting for it to ship lol

Agreed though"
Eldenring,RadThaddeus,Majula connects directly to just as many places as Firelink. js
Eldenring,RadThaddeus,As much shit that DS2 gets...Glad to see people actually got some sense!
Eldenring,ThatDeliveryDude,"This and Stonefang tunnel in Demon Souls, specifically 2-1 before you actually enter the tunnels the outside looks very much similar to this fan art"

Eldenring,Dodeejeroo,Stonefang Tunnel
Eldenring,hunterkola,That's Knack II baby
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,Your burden of bringing this knowledge was a heavy one and I thank you for it.
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,"Fun fact: This is at the New Orleans Museum of Art, or the NOMA for short. Went here a while back and the sunset was hitting the ring just right so that it looked like it was the sun, lovely day."
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,"I personally think it would be interesting if they had a somewhat overhaul to the summoning/invading mechanic. I remember there was a fake leak for Sekiro where they said the invading in Sekiro would have you enter another player's world as a monster with a new attack pattern, stats, etc. based on what area you invaded in and I think that could be amazing."
Eldenring,sexy-betoven,"Yeah, Majula is hands down the most beloved hub in the series"
Eldenring,qwer1601,"So much aggresion.According to vaati bloodborne 2  could have a more central american aesthtic and this fits perfectly.Just because the first bloodborne was gritty victorian era, that doesnt mean the second one has to be equal.Also lovecraft wrote plenty about deserts and desolate places"
Eldenring,TheMasterSwordMaster,Shit now I'm hyped for Majula 2. Really though as long as it's not as dull as the dilapidated temple I'm interested to see anything they do.
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,"Doesn't come up for me, you might be too far hollow."
Eldenring,heyilikethistuff,haha ya this is pretty heavy content for a kids movie
Eldenring,JollyFan,gotchu üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
Eldenring,DrB1503,Savage
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,"I think it could be interesting if it was a hub like Majula, but as NPCs come they establish their own structures, slowly building up a little society in the midst of a dead world."
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,Majula has gotten a lot more love than I expected.
Eldenring,Orefounder,Oooooh Elden Ring
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,"I was right about it being fake.

[https://www.artstation.com/artwork/1ONRL](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/1ONRL)

Eldenring,HeavenDenied,This was an amazing game.
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,"It is from a four year old video.

Eldenring,Abysswalker_8,"[3 years, eh?](https://twitter.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1322361159945658368?s=20)"
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,Check the newest post in the sub today.
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,I would like to take this moment to flex on every single person who tried arguing with me on the first post about this leak when I said it could be easily faked.
Eldenring,Disciple_of_Oedon,There's a zero percent chance they were unaware.
Eldenring,Epic_Meow,this is the dark souls of replies to comments
Eldenring,Max_Tosin,Except e3's moments
Eldenring,ZenMacros,"Was pretty disappointed when I played the demo. I was pretty excited for the game. Didn't look amazing but looked solid and the character creation is fantastic, but the actual gameplay and levels were so mediocre I didn't even bother to finish the demo."
Eldenring,JollyFan,I'm really sorry.. but I didn't want to leave you in the sea of illusion..
Eldenring,NeverlastingDragon,"Yeah, it doesn't make much sense but that's just the way they are. I honestly doubt they even follow media that much, at least western media."
Eldenring,Batyara,I can't take it anymore....
Eldenring,Disciple_of_Oedon,"I understand that. However this isn't really the same. There was footage leaked online and spread all over the gaming interwebs that was supposedly Elden Ring. Debunking this would've required about the same amount of ""direct interaction"" with their customers as telling us about the sales milestones of the Souls series. No excuse."
Eldenring,lukhave12,And with most of the npcs in one place too like in ds3.
Eldenring,C__Wayne__G,"Dang, they went classic rpg route when naming the sequel"
Eldenring,LogansBigHat,What would anyone care if you leave or stay lol peace out young hollow
Eldenring,lukhave12,Are you really getting serious in this sub? Jesus
Eldenring,SarcasticJab,Sounds like you're saying you know more than the average person here.
Eldenring,[deleted],[deleted]
Eldenring,NeverlastingDragon,"I would've loved to get to see the the land of Carthus in Dark Souls 3. It's referred to in so many items, yet never seen. Supposedly, it's a big desert."
Eldenring,Bloodycaddy,That's amazing!
Eldenring,NeverlastingDragon,Called it.
Eldenring,NeverlastingDragon,"FROMSOFTWARE, like many other Japanese companies, rarely if ever engages directly with their customers."

Eldenring,LET-ME-HAVE-A-NAAME,"I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised, it is open world after all. It‚Äôs nearly a requirement."
Eldenring,RobN-Hood,"I've played both good rushed games and a bad delayed one, that quote doesn't really hold much water."
Eldenring,e_0,You have an interesting personality.
Eldenring,Velociferocks-,AoS 3rd edition is definitely getting announced on saturday.
Eldenring,whitt_en,ahh you forgot code vein: anime souls
Eldenring,awnawkareninah,"I finished that game like two months ago and I'll still find myself sitting at my desk at work muttering ""bunger bunger bunger"""
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,"I mean more like the gun mod for dark souls, not a parry system that cost ammo lol."
Eldenring,silentravens,"That's it. Thanks for the go ahead. I will now unsub and never post on here again, I'm super serious. Goodbye r/eldenring. Y'now how they say ""its been a good run well it hasn't"" quoting the great mike from breaking bad"
Eldenring,CREATURExFEATURE,S H A T T E R E D
Eldenring,marsgreekgod,Context is hard
Eldenring,TheZoneRanger,"Don't worry bro, were almost there"
Eldenring,Avenntus,Can't believe these guys are busting his balls for saying he saw a video and didn't know what to think of it. Jesus.
Eldenring,Snoo-72790,And to think it was a kids movie. I saw it in theaters.
Eldenring,BananaTsunami,All le hand drawn shit is what was popular back in my day.
Eldenring,SuperD00perGuyd00d,dark souls 2 is just pure fashion souls
Eldenring,tuxxxito,you got me at korean mmo üòÜ
Eldenring,Wamrage76,"Game is like Cuphead(Bosses only) minus Run &amp; Gun levels. It's highly underrated. I bet most have never even heard of it, let alone played it. Envious Levin Undok boss takes a lot of skill to beat. He/They have more moves than an octopus in a wrestling match."
Eldenring,motionScientist,Having deathblows in pvp would be interesting
Eldenring,weewoo128,I t o f f e r e d m e *E l d e n R i ng N e w s*
Eldenring,blitzen001,Get the slow horse. Mounted combat feels much nicer on the slow horse if it's your first time. The faster horse needs some getting used to because it's really frustrating if you already don't have a feel for it. Wouldn't recommend to newbies.
Eldenring,Toriiz,I just want to see a new elden ring trailer....
Eldenring,Plaguestarter,Brightstone Cove Tseldora was somewhat desert-y
Eldenring,DanglerSpangler,"It's been under two years and we've had a few glimers of hope, and some evidence of development. It could be much worse, considering the global pandemic. I am confident in E3. If for nothing else, Fromsoftware understands the fanatic nature of its base and wouldn't intentionally mistreat them. Two years is long enough."
Eldenring,1stNone,"It was pretty convincing, but personally I was completely indifferent to whether it was real or not.

The stakes were incredibly low on this one. I'm surprised people cared to debunk it. Great job though."
Eldenring,angelgraduo,Fuck I would love to see a wandering massive boss ala Shadow of the Colossus
Eldenring,1stNone,"You'll be alright soon, man."
Eldenring,angelgraduo,That's amazing
Eldenring,Brickybob,"Just my standard advice: always start with stray knight for one of the best weapons, the black scimitar, especially when enchanted with a ruinous gem later on, as well as the frankly excessive amounts of health from the start.

Another tip is to go straight to the Demons Woods right after beating the tutorial. I know the progression wants you to best a few areas before then, if you have experience with other souls games it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to get through, and you get a ton of upgrade materials and Bewitching stones early on, as well as a couple merchants."
Eldenring,Waycool499,"That‚Äôs true, same with falling off edges with full health. It would just spawn you back up but with a big chunk of health missing"
Eldenring,chillyboy456,Can I... borrow it?
Eldenring,MyHeartsMistakes,"Kinda already is, isn't it?"
Eldenring,chillyboy456,"I haven't hollowed yet, bby. I'm still patiently waiting..."
Eldenring,BingusBongo134,what the fuck i just thought about how there's no deserts in from soft games
Eldenring,Leg4IsHere,"I think jumping and SWIMMING souls would be more fitting. I mean it was one thing that you could climb, jump, and stealth in the game...but you DID not die whenever you accidentally jumped into water"
Eldenring,Anime_Fan_15,"Oh please, your going hollow, everyone here can can barly type english properly."
Eldenring,No_Faithlessness3666,"DS1 poise, but get rid of the stat that lets you carry more weight so your forced to fat roll if your armor is too good."
Eldenring,marsgreekgod,"Yeah. also they saw a poster. so they are a double false prophet.

e3 hype ü§°ü§°ü§°"
Eldenring,Duy012,Yeah you‚Äôre right. So the dream guy is a false prophet too. One after another. But surely it will be at E3.ü§°
Eldenring,bohemiantranslation,You're doing God's work my friend. This makes me wonder if the original leaks were fake also or if someone just has too much time on their hands and is pretty decent at editing.
Eldenring,No_Faithlessness3666,E3 is too lazy to update that list everyday. For all we know Bandai has already made plans to go.
Eldenring,bohemiantranslation,Debunked
Eldenring,bohemiantranslation,Depending on your circulation
Eldenring,hlkxsjhv,I already have been for months
Eldenring,iASk_9,"‚ÄúGame needs an easy mode, if you say otherwise you‚Äôre not a fan‚Äù"
Eldenring,MeirIeach,"Maybe wait until we can actually play it before you go proclaiming it the best game ever, yeah?"
Eldenring,iHelpt,This.  I'd really hate to see From Software follow suit and just release broken games for the sake of pleasing investors.
Eldenring,Triforcesarecool,"The game can literally be tackled in any order at that point, if you have trouble with them fight the other bosses and come back at a higher level. Thats really basic common sense."
Eldenring,3azrine,trash graphics literally ps2 graphics + repetitive gameplay yet unnecessarily hard +needs an easy mode for accessibility and inclusiveness and elden ring is an overhyped trash oh and also glaive master hodir is not really a master...
Eldenring,METOgaming,Scholar of the second sin??
Eldenring,DarkCrowI,I have enough faith in FromSoftware that if they delay a game they are doing it for the right reasons.
Eldenring,tema3210,There's no point then
Eldenring,RSG2033,lol Elden Ring isn‚Äôt even out yet. But I hope you‚Äôre right.
Eldenring,undayerixon,*points down*
Eldenring,ZzzleepyDinosaur,Nioh is better
Eldenring,ISZATSA,don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted lol
Eldenring,dr_gould,Downvoted because Petrus‚Äô bitch ass isn‚Äôt dead
Eldenring,GregoryPorter1337,Praise the moon
Eldenring,goatamon,"That's interesting cause I would have said the only thing I think DS1 really does better than DS3 is level design, which is pretty same-y in DS3. That, and possibly the lore.

Slow melee combat is a gripe that I have with what honestly feels like most games. The weapons are obviously inspired by real life weapons, which weren't slow or clunky at all, so why does our mystical hero have such a hard time swinging a claymore around?

But, it is of course very subjective and dependent on what you personally want out of a game."
Eldenring,Grognak_the_Orc,I mean just in general. It's obvious textures were downscaled to fit requirements by how muddied they are.  Not everything is like this and it's style more than makes up for it but it's obvious Dark Souls 3 is way better despite being a year apart.
Eldenring,ISZATSA,he‚Äôll be in a fursuit and serve as lionwolf
Eldenring,Wild_Alfalfa606,That is a special moment the first time you stroll down there!
Eldenring,Indercarnive,Bring back bonfire ascetics.
Eldenring,AzaelKyle,"It's a souls like coming out ""normally"" this year. It's developed by 2 guys and even if their principal inspiration is ZBOTW their game look amazing and very much like a dark souls."
Eldenring,travvylala,God I hope so tbh
Eldenring,[deleted],[deleted]
Eldenring,EternalGodLordRetard,"Yes there is, but at the same time there this thing called player preference, maybe you like to spend time walking to and from everywhere and if so that is fine. I however dislike walking everywhere. Again, pre lord vessel it doesnt much matter if there is a bonfire there."
Eldenring,ISZATSA,man this new elder scrolls game looks weird af
Eldenring,DancesWithCouch,At least until Bloodborne Kart comes out ;)
Eldenring,Yterbio,I would be THE GAME
Eldenring,flipperkip97,There's only one Fromsoft game in my top five favourite games... *pause...* and it's not Bloodborne.
Eldenring,Immortal-Beans,Elden Ring will end like Game of Thrones
Eldenring,Bolt_om,theres a bonfire inside the depts. you only need to go inside once. it's really not that big of deal.
Eldenring,iHelpt,"Without all the blood, Bloodborne was just an okay game."
Eldenring,sweetperdition,"This is the worst thing I‚Äôve ever seen in this sub, this wins"
Eldenring,Immortal-Beans,Elden Ring will end like Game of Thrones.
Eldenring,EternalGodLordRetard,"To farm humanity. Ik there is a shortcut but if you are short humanity pre lord vessel you don't have much choice. Typically, I'd stock up on humanity to increase drop rates then go farm for resources whether it be blightown or lothric castle. Sometimes though just want humanity in general."
Eldenring,Bolt_om,"thats the whole point. the game forces you to commit to an area so you cant feel like you cant escape to your little safe space whenever you feel like it. 

this is why none of the areas in the later games are imposing or feel dangerous. you can escape anytime."
Eldenring,picardiamexicana,PS3 GRAPHICS LULW
Eldenring,saal_sol,"Lets be honest. Even if it looked like DaS3, it would look beautiful. Because DaS3 looks absolutely beautiful, a bit dull colour-wise, yes. But beautiful!"
Eldenring,SignificantLacke,World Of Warcraft book by George Martin would be cool as hell
Eldenring,ISZATSA,Elden Ring is just more of the same
Eldenring,RecommendationIcy382,Ds2 was better
Eldenring,skdsn,Improved technical aspects on PC.
Eldenring,Bolt_om,why would you want to revisit the depths pre lord vessel? or ever? anyway theres a shortcut near firelinks shrine.
Eldenring,myxomat00sis,i made a post saying this weeks ago and everybody here got really salty lol
Eldenring,ImNotBlueBanana,this game sucks because it doesnt have an easy mode
Eldenring,masschock99,Lol relax little fella. Even gamespot made a post saying that Black Myth looks like sekiro.
Eldenring,pinknoscope,"Wait, Bloodborne was downgraded? Where can I find what the original version looked like?"
Eldenring,Bolt_om,it literally takes less than a minute to get where you need. how is that tedious?? i've played ds1 half a dozen times and the lack of FT was never tedious.
Eldenring,ErnestoXP,"I have complete faith in Miyazaki honestly, he hasn't missed ONCE yet"
Eldenring,Accomplished_Sink202,The Valkyrie is looking dominant and breedable
Eldenring,masschock99,I haven't actually. But i've played blasphemous lately. Is it good?
Eldenring,Interestng,Yeah It seems that some cutscenes could be an issue for hair as opposed to how it looks during gameplay which is pretty good
Eldenring,BreakfastKupcakez,Delayed to 2023.
Eldenring,felipevsw,Easy mode confirmed by Michael Zaki.
Eldenring,BreakfastKupcakez,I‚Äôd buy it.
Eldenring,trifecta000,"It's a helmet, just like in Prometheus. Yes it makes no sense, just like in Prometheus."
Eldenring,milgos1,Dark souls 2 was a good game
Eldenring,hday108,Fashion souls (Elden bling) will suck in this game and lack cool clothes
Eldenring,McCiocco,It would be epic
Eldenring,etrulzz,Well.. what's the point then?
Eldenring,[deleted],[deleted]
Eldenring,bulletproofvan,"DS1: holding block simulator

Eldenring,suspenderman96,This game sucks because it doesn‚Äôt have invincible mode.
Eldenring,Ne0guri,We encountered an immense amount of issues and will have to delay this game until the foreseeable future
Eldenring,Zomeiro,"The hair looked really wonky around ‚ÄúI command thee kneel‚Äù. That, and just how it feels *wrong* are the main reason I don‚Äôt really like the hair. It‚Äôs definitely a step up from previous titles though."
Eldenring,Jack_Empty,I've gotten to a point where only fashion matters. I feel confident in my abilities to survive whether I'm tanky or not.
Eldenring,OtterBadgerSnake,"I haven't yet because I'm waiting on info for the collector's edition but I voted ""yes"" since I plan to no matter what."
Eldenring,Switcheroe,This one triggered me goddamn it xD.
Eldenring,unlucky-man-98,"You shouldn‚Äôt have to read supplemental material for a game‚Äôs narrative to be good !

There I said it."
Eldenring,KalebTheAmazing_,POST IT TO TWITTER TO GET LORE!!!
Eldenring,ThrallArtsu,Boooo. Bad opinion
Eldenring,DarkCrowI,Just our of principle against pre-orders or something else?
Eldenring,Purrserker,"There were certain weapons like the Warped Sword which got special moves when combined with specific weapon types. I loved power stancing that in the left hand with Rickard's Rapier in the right, all flowy and stabby."
Eldenring,dark_angel-666,"Well maby but elden ring has to be one he'll of a game to beat bloodborne 

But I guess we'll see when it's released"
Eldenring,Dirken117,"Wait what about the ring symbol flair?

EDIT: sad times."
Eldenring,Dreamishhh,Bruh I just wanted some treasure and he literally kicked my ass for it :(
Eldenring,amisupposed2care,*Laughs in Elden*
Eldenring,Aguythatdidthething,Unless ER changes something we know the only connected games are the DS series. Things like the Moonlight greatsword are thematic elements that have been in From games since before Demon's souls. Moonlight greatsword was first in King's field for example. The other games like Sekiro and Bloodborne only share mechanical aspects.
Eldenring,GandalfsMemoryStick,What if the sun doesn‚Äôt come up tomorrow?
Eldenring,KeewiwiA7X,We can only hope! BB was amazing
Eldenring,KeewiwiA7X,"No, and I'm not planning to pre-order it unless there's a bonus or something special coming with the pre-order version, I'm buying it on release day"
Eldenring,Ok_Estate_3354,Damn right!
Eldenring,DarkCrowI,What do you mean? If you are referring to digitally I have no idea but if you are referring to physically it has been available for pre-order for quite awhile. I pre-ordered it for PS4 in 2019 and changed my pre-order to PS5 this year.
Eldenring,Jack_Empty,"If he's not a vendor, dead."
Eldenring,distinguishedbotato,I voted yes cause I'm a liar. Although if it was possible I would have pre-ordered it. Unfortunately there's on such option on Steam yet.
Eldenring,GandalfsMemoryStick,"Can‚Äôt pre-order on steam yet, but I will when we can."
Eldenring,2ndbA2,There literally isn‚Äôt any reason why there shouldn‚Äôt be
Eldenring,Lobo5thousand,But ice non the less

Eldenring,Dovahkiin_56,"Man I would love that for ds3, love Gael, hate going back into ng to fight him again"
Eldenring,aisatsana06,"Careful, Tarnished. You're walking on thin ice."
Eldenring,Ok_Estate_3354,"I know lol I should have worded it better.
How about ‚ÄúHow will patches trick you next in Elden Ring?‚Äù
Or maybe ‚ÄúHide your Kids, hide your Wife! What does patches have in store for us this time?‚Äù.
Something like that...."
Eldenring,dootdoor25543,"You're welcome, good luck!!"
Eldenring,Aware-Strawberry5636,Feet are disgusting.
Eldenring,BeastHunter42,It's just open world dark souls
Eldenring,Hjalmar_Nikolasson,"Calling it now , that thing drops the Moonlight Greatsword"
Eldenring,MarcusOPolo,"As long as it has ADP, I'll be happy."
Eldenring,MordakThePrideful,Elden Ring just looks like a Dark Souls ripoff.
Eldenring,Tygone,The graphics don't even look good.
Eldenring,Seppeissep,You monster!
Eldenring,AstralSozin,Great fucking show
Eldenring,Shartle,This seems like not worth worrying about until we actually know what everything will be like.
Eldenring,Shartle,"Same. I‚Äôm gonna stock up on weed and snacks, I‚Äôm taking at least 4 days off. Only thing is i might actually have to move to another state for work right around then but it‚Äôs looking like February. I have been saving time off lol. Working as much as i can until then. I even told my gf like yo I‚Äôm gonna be kinda busy then and she doesn‚Äôt really know."
Eldenring,Buuhhu,"plenty says it, what the comment you replied to said is the biggest complaint about BotW everyone brings up. with maybe the exception being the breakable weapons, that one is discussed alot some hate some like. people who hate it want to be able to find good weapons and keep them, people who like it like that it forces you to try different weapons.

the copy paste shrines even the most avid zelda fans dont really like, the puzzles in there are ok, but variety in themes are sorely lacking."
Eldenring,Shartle,The Zweihander is my favorite. It was my training wheels for these games. Especially ds1.
Eldenring,HeadlessVengarl95,"Yes, I do believe so"
Eldenring,goodluckmyway,"Nah, if you were fighting monsters ten times your size you'd be using spears, like literal neanderthals did hunting mammoths. 

Where the pointy stick gang at?"
Eldenring,Nethermoosen,That is one way to insult half the subreddit. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Eldenring,[deleted],[deleted]
Eldenring,BoostMobileAlt,I wonder how balance in this game will be. Is there going to be a lot of content on the map essentially locked off due to difficulty? If you explore too much are you going to be OP in the legacy dungeons?
Eldenring,You__Nwah,"I feel like based on recent posts on this subreddit, people equate density with size."
Eldenring,Thelifeofpewpew,"It's fine. Like botw did, take the time it needs.. no one wants another cyberpunked.."

Eldenring,Quantam-Law,"Is there any specific reason Nintendo/The Pokemon Company/Gamefreak don't put effort into Pokemon at all? Is it just to save time, effort and money because they know their games are going to sell like hotcakes anyway? I'm curious about this."
Eldenring,[deleted],[deleted]
Eldenring,You__Nwah,"""My opinion differs to yours, stop having your opinion""."
Eldenring,Nethermoosen,And the fact we have a subterranean map toggle for the overworld map.
Eldenring,KeeN_Flame,"ah thats clean then, nice"
Eldenring,knobot-200T,nice drawing
Eldenring,Nethermoosen,Yes. Absolutely. Some in the subreddit just don‚Äôt seem to recall.
Eldenring,errorhandling69,i doubt u can fathom it
Eldenring,Nethermoosen,It‚Äôs just about the perception. The point of view. I am not comparing the two in any other way. Lmao
Eldenring,Sun_Boy,THE Sekiro Guru???
Eldenring,Nethermoosen,"Euro gamer reported this after the 16 minute demo: ‚ÄúFrom says; both Legacy Dungeons and the Overworld itself encompass a huge variety of environments and biomes, each with their own unique characteristics and dangers to face. We were told there were wintery plains and snow-capped peaks, a flooded city, and a whole other range of diverse maps, each with their own distinct flavour.‚Äù"
Eldenring,Alpha_pro2019,"Imagine specifically finding a hidden dungeon just to fight the secret boss inside.

I love the thought."
Eldenring,DiomedesofCarim,Ni!
Eldenring,KeeN_Flame,Dunno they could go from middle of europe themed to mediterranen to more south like kingdom of heaven
Eldenring,NewtonNext,Shinkenjer rocks ü•≥
Eldenring,Nethermoosen,Overhyping what? I was talking about perception. What we see vs what we don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt blame me for what you read into things.
Eldenring,goodluckmyway,"by someone, or something"
Eldenring,Adrald,Facts
Eldenring,picardiamexicana,"POWER THE BASS CANNON

*FIRE*"
Eldenring,UninterestedChimp,Or it turns out that the ring was never shattered at all üò≥
Eldenring,KeeN_Flame,"Yeah like the scope of the whole world is in the landscape screenshot. It prob feels a lot bigger when we are walking in the landscape itself. but I think thats just the midle of the map, and on each corner theres a dungeon. I dont think theres 6 more of these landscapes. Ussually what games show is what you get. Most of the time a trailer is a combination of the best things of a game, and a short clip the best they can show from the trailer, and a screenshot the best they can show from a clip. I guess maybe from software at this point can show a little less cause they've built up so much trust. But they still need to sell their games which means showing the best things (aka show goddrick etc.) What you see is what you get ussually. Im personally a bit dissapointed in the big picture landscape screenshot. I hope there is more than just this thematic. I want more and different biomes and a bit less tectonic plates looking areas."
Eldenring,Accomplished-East635,"I completely disagree. In a world that massive, yes there is gonna be a lot of emptiness that you will run into. It doesn‚Äôt really take away from how amazing the game is, I‚Äôm pretty sure a lot of people will disagree about replayability as many, myself included, have played the game many times over."
Eldenring,DaGrotSlaya,We could claim Lord Souls only to let the world descend into darkness in DS1. It is not a foreign concept in From games.
Eldenring,Redpo0l,"In DS3, we had option to put all 4 cinders of lords together just to snuff them out once and for all."
Eldenring,Captainbeefster,"Yeah that screenshot and a lot of the other things we‚Äôve seen is only one of six (I believe) main kingdoms. 

From usually does that to a certain extent, where they only really show off of of the beginning areas in the promotional material. 

Other than the very brief glimpses of other areas, like the underground, the spooky Cainhurst-esque castle, the forest area, the swamp/bog, and a place that‚Äôs snowy I think. 

Not to mention from what we‚Äôve seen there‚Äôs multiple underground locations."
Eldenring,nogills,my man
Eldenring,Zvbfagglet,"SNAP BACK

Eldenring,Berblarez,Definitely. Skyrim really ruined it for me.
Eldenring,eriolvonnova,"no thing, let trust  fromsoftware"
Eldenring,Brandon_YougerPrince,Breath is not even that good. The world design is boring. Stop overhyping it so much.
Eldenring,banana_man_777,"STOP! That actually made me super excited. I'm almost done Platinuming Bloodborne, I can only get so erect."
Eldenring,Captainbeefster,Yes one is a man with a hammer and one is a woman with staff or something. They seem like they‚Äôre meant to be in the same location.
Eldenring,Early_Flan_4599,Yep. Try and replay the game again. You just can't. Its an empty map with all of the same. Very overrated.
Eldenring,Early_Flan_4599,half of it is exploring which means the excitement goes away after first playthrough. And the area is actually not very dense. Its honestly quite empty.
Eldenring,Early_Flan_4599,massively empty. cant replay that game worth shit imo
Eldenring,rqhany,Woop
Eldenring,Rand2024,Just rock my shit bro
Eldenring,yukadfsa2,"it seems like your character will be much more physically enhanced than in dark souls, but there were a lot of greatswords in the trailer"

Eldenring,bumpdog,"yeah i'm not gonna pretend like I never enjoyed an open world game, but after playing a bunch you start noticing how formulaic and predictable they are no matter the setting"

Eldenring,EvieShudder,"I expect this will be some kind of gender-ambiguous god figure. It‚Äôs done a bit in Norse mythology, which Elden ring is loosely inspired by. Represented by changing body type and sex when the camera cuts throughout the trailer"

Eldenring,FenrisulfrV,"Paladin, like every game before. Heavy armor, faith, greatsword/longsword+shield."

Eldenring,Acal0wastaken,"Truly! Not only are they annoying, the only real counter they have completely ruins the atmosphere of the dungeon. If you‚Äôre bum-rushing or running past every spooky guy you see the place loses it‚Äôs flair and the environment feels bland. Especially because you can 2-3 shot them if you‚Äôve been keeping your weapons appropriately upgraded."

Eldenring,nick2473got,"It's not that punishing. You can easily store your sen by buying coin purses from merchants. Problem solved.

As for exp, it's extremely easy to earn on a first playthrough. Losing half your progress to the next point is of no consequence whatsoever, you'll get it back and much more once you beat the boss you're stuck on. 

Acquired skill points aren't lost so you can always just spend 2 min grinding the next point before retrying the boss if you're really worried. 

But 9 times out of 10 it doesn't matter in the slightest. Beating the boss or mini-boss will get you back where you were."
Eldenring,Spyger9,"The multiplayer shit-show of the first month(s).

Eldenring,Knight-Skywalker,"I LOVED Tomb of the Giants, because to me, the darkness was part of the adventure and another puzzle to solve and challenge to overcome. I love how the Souls games force you to find creative ways to adapt to certain situations and figure out and develop strategies for getting through an area all on your own, especially on your first play through. It adds to the feeling of ‚Äúadventure‚Äù to me."

Jack shit until aside from that until release."
Eldenring,DarienMC,"Mordecai seemed to have had a change of heart when it comes to posting leaked gameplay footage ever since word of that private gameplay showcase held by FromSoftware came out. You know, the one where other souls content creators like Vaatividya were invited to but not him. Note that there has been no leaked footage of that event as far as I'm aware of.

I think he determined that he had to remove the leaked early-build footage from his channel if he wanted to secure a chance to attend exclusive opportunities like these and to maintain good rapport with FromSoftware/Bandai Namco from here on out. It's likely a symbolic act to build trust more than anything else since the ""damage"" from these leaks have been done already."
Eldenring,RombieZombie25,"Just saying, y‚Äôall look stupid as fuck. There is both a cinematic and a gameplay trailer at this point. And there is a network test happening in 2 weeks.

Eldenring,Fruitspunchredd,"I‚Äôd say a mix of things basically the game is pitched to be a culmination of all the souls games with a newer setting and more freedom yet we‚Äôve only gotten a teaser, some screen shots and one trailer with less than 3 months to go. Part of it is people stressing the game will be delayed again so they vent their frustrations on marketing who in my opinion would love to put out more content but Fromsoft won‚Äôt let them. I‚Äôm hoping in two weeks there will not only be tons of gameplay from the cnt and they will start marketing like crazy but we shall see."
Eldenring,Cjham875,It's a trap they're gonna insta ban any streams lol

Drip-feeding along the course of the wait til release instead of releasing a full 16 minute gameplay showcase(this is the correct term, I'm getting sick and tired of people calling it a trailer.), even though I wouldn't complain if we got that too. If done well, it keeps people chomping at the bit til they get to experience the product for themselves."

Eldenring,shen_black,"A little correction tho, Demon¬¥s Souls current release wasn¬¥t only made by FS or miyazaki, it was a collab with the director of Sony Japan Studio (RIP), he is as much of a father to the Demon¬¥s Souls we know and the souls formula as miyazaki, he sadly passed away. and miyazaki continued the formula and perfected it with Dark Souls. in other ways, Sony itself produced the game, and the president of sony hate it."
Eldenring,BrooksMania,"Agree100%.

I will say, though, that from what I've seen, the boss designs look silly. Almost like they ran out of ideas, kind of like pokemon after a couple of generations. Like, ""What now?"" ""Idk... How about a fucking candle Pokemon?""

But... I am totally ready to eat shut crusted crow on this one criticism of what little we have seen."
Eldenring,shen_black,"Considering how bizarre Demon¬¥s Souls was back in those days I don¬¥t blame shugei at all. Very hard game to get into, very niche, an experimental mess all around.

When Dark Souls was about to get released I heard about demon¬¥s souls, and I also hated it, it was extremely bizzare, punishing and nothing made sense, it was too experimental. SO I get if Shugei with only two hours ended up hating the game.

But Clearly Sony and FS have a good relationship considering they decided to repeat the story with Bloodborne.

Lets not forget that Demon¬¥s Souls and bloodborne are a cooperative effort made by Sony Japan Studio and From Software. 

They twist the story of how the souls games begin by making an underdog story against the big bad company sony, but the reality its completely the opposite, Sony and FS are both the parents of the souls saga."

Meanwhile, FromSoft is pretty transparent on how the game is going to look like. CMTs essentialy give people way to demo the game. Content creators are free to voice their opinions on it. You have everything out and in the open, nothing bad with just wanting to get your hands on it already."

Take a look at a decent game. Fortnite for example doesnt even have any hacker issues. Why, do you ask? Because they actually bothered to implement an anticheat.

Hackers on PC gamed will only become a problem if game devs allow it to. I dont know how many times I have to repeat this"

Eldenring,bobazoole,No  because I don't got a Ps3 or a ps5 so that's why but i want to play it then I can say I completed all of the soul games and I can't wait for elden ring Good night

Eldenring,Graitom,It's truly one of my downfalls as a redditor ü•≤
Eldenring,BurningTongues,How else you going to prove to your homies back in the village that you went hard that last battle?
Eldenring,Tawdry-Audrey,"It's not the CPU cache, it's a cache is the shader code the engine uses to render materials. In many modern game engines (including Elden Ring, I'm assuming), materials (individual textures and all their associated data) are saved as independent shaders (code that the GPU runs). On PC this code needs to compile on the user's PC so it can configure itself correctly for their hardware. Many games will do this during loading screens but it appears Elden Ring does it when the material first comes into view.   
Take this with a grain of salt, I don't know much about From Software's game engine, I'm just a UE4 indie game dev. I'm also not a programmer, just a level designer, but our team's programmer knows his stuff and has explained how UE4 material rendering works to me. My big assumption here is that From's game engine works similarly to UE4."
Eldenring,TaitoMagatsuu,True!
Eldenring,xCarpathian94,is that real real?

Eldenring,Censius,"Well, I'm not sure Demons Soul is a 10/10"
Eldenring,Felipesantoro,"Man... See the map again, those times are for PC RELEASES THAT ARE GLOBAL so yes, in those times the game would release at 4pm western, what is 7pm eastern, what is the same moment in time. The disclaimer on the bottom left in both maps explains that these times are only for PC, that again would be released at the same moment globaly, what in that exemple it means 4pm western and 7pm eastern, that is why they make it into a map format to be easy for people to understand what time it will be in their time zone the moment the game releases globaly. BUT CONSOLES DONT FOLLOW THAT RULE, their release is not simultaneous like the PC, their relase is midnight in each time zone, so again yes people on diferrent time zones would play the game at diferrent moments on consoles (all at 00:00 in their time zones, what is not the same moment). I dont know how i could explain it better if you dont get it, just pay attention to what those two maps that i send are saying, the Cyberpunk one is more clear."

I ended up using the dual winged axes till the end, fucking awesome weapons"
Eldenring,ExpressFirefighter16,preloading?
Eldenring,loen00,Doesn't look similar at all
Eldenring,Origamiface,"&gt;OHHHHHH

cringe"
Eldenring,SmelDefart,"It's really not, but instead of downvoting i thought i'd try to explain. Motion blur makes sense at 30fps (in games) and 24fps (in movies) because those framerates are so low that they are barely accepted by our brains as a single smooth motion. So, exagerating motions by blurring them helps hide the chopiness of the framerate.

Now when a game runs at 60fps (or even higher) motions take up twice or more frames on screen (from beginning to end), making them waaay smoother to our brains and potentially even causing our eyes to automatically blur very fast motions just like they would in real life. It's in this case that adding motion blur hurts more than it helps, because at 60+fps the blur applied to any motions lasts for sooo many frames on the screen that it ends up looking unnatural and distracting.

Maybe you are used to playing at 30fps, in which case i'd agree with your post, but if you often play on pc at 60fps and still enable motion blur i would love to urge you to check out playing some games with it enabled and then again with it disabled. If the game really is running at a high framerate then it should look more pleasing to the eye if it's disabled"
Eldenring,justlookin3348,Playing Returnal. It‚Äôs scratching my difficulty itch while still be relatively low commitment.
Eldenring,jdp111,It's funny how we just got a new trailer and streamers literally playing the game but people are only talking about a sword not being straight.
Eldenring,WhiteSilverDragoon,"They do, so many people doom posting and the stutters arnt even that bad. 

It's likley a combination of shader caching and not having up to date GPU drivers, we will also likley get a patch on release. 

Everyone needs to calm down."
Eldenring,GoodGrades,"Improperly balancing the traditional souls formula with open world exploration. Locking people in too much with builds, making it too difficult to experiment with new weapons and gear."
Eldenring,IAmARetardo,Yeah I have the same on my page in Aus. We will see.
Eldenring,stankywankypusspuss,Have you played bloodborne and sekiro ?
Eldenring,chaosyami,"How has this become a constant argument?
I see it everyday now just different maths"
Eldenring,Amaurotica,"nioh 2 &gt; ds3

pepelaugh oh no no no"
Eldenring,Rositoo,"You Will be with us in soul, us whoopers are one in the same brother"
Eldenring,noiamnotabanana,"doubt they'll be making another, the first included everything to the story, and despite the fact that it would be nice to have more trick weapons and gameplay, it probably would mess with the story and be unnecessary. Regardless, playstation would probably fund that too, as they funded the first and it was a huge success"
Eldenring,ghpkhg,Isn‚Äôt armor differences usually/mostly irrelevant in DS3?
Eldenring,real_Lejon_Brames,Sekiro has highest skill ‚Äúfloor‚Äù. Its hardest to learn but once you learn its the easiest one by far. It took me maybe 90% of my first playthrough to get a hang of it but now I can easily finish the game without dying.
Eldenring,IWantToBeTheBoshy,"Congrats! Orphan needed to be put out of its misery. Did you make sure to look closely at where he came from? 

I just pray for a 60 fps update!"
Eldenring,james1221432,This is just fucking weird
Eldenring,PotatoKun01,"It'd be the first MLG to not be blue since friggin King's Field, which would be kinda cool"
Eldenring,Irapelolisforaliving,LMAO WHAT
Eldenring,james1221432,6x9???
Eldenring,ghpkhg,"DS3 felt like a gimmick game to me, whereas 1&amp;2 felt skillful and satisfying to beat.  

Gimmicks are boring"
Eldenring,Siverman,Lol there‚Äôs literally a status effect in elden ring called ‚Äúinstant death‚Äù
Eldenring,gel_ink,"I agree.  I don't mind the concept either, kinda like it, but the execution wasn't great (imo it'd be better only tied to rolls rather than item use too).  PvE is perfectly doable without leveling ADP (I've done it on one character as a challenge run, just played tanky and there's more than enough healing in DS2 for that to be viable), but it puts you at a massive disadvantage in PvP."
Eldenring,ghpkhg,I thought elden ring was already released? I‚Äôm confused
Eldenring,azureJiro,But sad. Hope Sekiro was not a standalone misfit
Eldenring,Life_Hunt,Shoes
Eldenring,Ionsus,Not true. They specifically did not want this game to have dlc. Nothing to do with anything other than the fact the FS treats games as art.
Eldenring,snorlz,an entire area that is poison
Eldenring,Deus_FP,Trick weapons
Eldenring,CellularBeing,"I only experienced noticable fps drops in areas like blight town when stuck would break. 

I picked it up for 30$ so Id consider it a decent deal."
Eldenring,Officer_Hotpants,I'll always miss trick weapons and gun parrying. And honestly I've ALWAYS been a fan of Victorian aesthetics so the firearms were my JAM.
Eldenring,splurgeoverthem,Only other consumables I use are poison antidotes
Eldenring,Bion2005,The magic is actually good from what we've seen in the cnt this game will give you a lot more freedom than the previous ones so you will probably use magic to an extent in all builds also ashes of war can change your weapon's scaling so you can use both melee and range attacks and not have to prioritize long range horseback and magic are a great communication also some bosses will have more physical resistance so magic or faith (which is equally good for the same reasons) would be optimal finally you get a lot more fp than previous games the only negative is you have to level mind for more fp instead of just only int but that is what you had to do in all games [side note faith is the stat you use for miracles AND pyromancies instead of both int and faith so faith might be better but i prefer magic also arcane the new equivalent to luck might affect some spells but i wouldn't invest in it unless i knew what i was getting in return]
Eldenring,ViLe_Rob,Cool I'll look into it because that sounds super exciting for build diversity
Eldenring,TaylorRoyal23,"Yeah, this is exactly most people's problem with the floaty feeling. I will never understand why they used a diamond deadzone in a game that basically requires precise character positioning in 360 degree game space."
Eldenring,Noporopo79,"Fights being multi-stage for the sake of being multi stage, rather than having a second stage that is actually fun or ads to the story. Second Phases in boss fights can be an incredible story telling mechanic if used to emphasise important fights, rather than just be there to pad out the length of the game. And when there‚Äôs so many second phases to develop, some will inevitably become unfinished and unfair and just make the first phase actively worse by existing. The pontiffs second phase, the crystal sages second phase, the curse rotten great woods second phase, Iundex Gundyrs second phase or the dancers first phase. All of these phases are very obviously only added because Miyazaki just said ‚Äúthis boss needs a second phase‚Äù rather than having an interesting or original idea for one. It‚Äôs like that line in the incredibles, ‚Äúif everyone‚Äôs special, then no one is,‚Äù

Also, overabundance of gank bosses. When done right gank bosses can be the most exhilarating fights in the entire game (O+S, Shadows of Yharnam, Demon Princes). But when done wrong they can be utter bullshit. If there‚Äôs so many in a game, a lot of them are more likely to be total bullshit"
Eldenring,austinskirk,I‚Äôd like to be able to progress in the game while playing in a friends game.
Eldenring,TheChrisPMan,"Oooh, fair enough! I certainly hope we get stuff like that again"
Eldenring,Bexexexe,Beasthood is Magic
Eldenring,Xvexe,"I'm waiting to see if it plays well on PC. For some reason, Japanese games are infamous for bad PC ports. Hell, we even needed DSFix for Dark Souls so even FromSoft has been guilty of this. DS3 had a pretty bad laggy/stuttering problem at launch as well."
Eldenring,foreignsky,"Thank God. I love these games, but personally have never enjoyed the PvP. I have good internet and still somehow always get backstabbed by a guy standing in front of me. That's not fun, that's bad net code."
Eldenring,SwaxOnSwaxOff,I can‚Äôt wait for games to move away from the roll. A dash just looks way more natural imo
Eldenring,Smoothpieguy27,Nah able to be used with long swords at the very least. Check out ‚Äúquickstep Elden Ring‚Äù
Eldenring,Sikosh,"The meteor/gravity magic is close, but I'm sure there's tons of spells we haven't seen yet. I have hope!"
Eldenring,SwaxOnSwaxOff,Just went from bloodborne to demon souls and oof I feel this üòÇ
Eldenring,Sikosh,I'm so hyped to work out what the deal is with the whole 2 fingers / 3 fingers thing and the hand enemy from the trailers. Whats the significance of fingers in this world?
Eldenring,TheMacDaddy_06,Bad netcode for pvp/pve
Eldenring,imanut2,I died so many times at this spot I never wanna feel that kinda pain and sense of hopelessness again haha
Eldenring,ViLe_Rob,Yeah seems like one for daggers at least
Eldenring,Sikosh,Gwyn v2?
Eldenring,Blaz9,That‚Äôs a really amazing idea
Eldenring,MustyRusty,I think Nioh2 did this very well
Eldenring,NightValeCytizen,"Let me tell you about my personal lord and savior, transformed rifle spear charged attack...

Real talk though, my first ever run of BB I was often discouraged by difficulty, as I'd never played a From Soft game. When I entered the forbidden wood, I had just started using the ""knifle"" and tried out all of its attacks, at which point I found that transformed charge attacks could 1-shot or 2-shot most enemies from outside their aggro range. It changed my whole perspective on life."
Eldenring,SwordofFlames,Perfectly fair trade imo
Eldenring,VisualObstruction,Pimp Cane Boi‚Äôs unite. I beat Paarl at level 1 with a pimp cane and that‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve ever done.
Eldenring,SausMastrJah,At least we got mounts this time
Eldenring,AliceInRaccoonCity,Choo choo mother fucker!

Eldenring,FudgeNo3314,"Let it sink in for a moment that we went from some extreme minimalistic leaks (where we all freaked out over being able to jump) to radio-silence for a couple months more, until the SGF Trailer released us, until we had the No-Marketing Arc and now we are in the last month without Elden Ring."
Eldenring,Dolormight,I'm going to pre order on the 23rd with hopes of pre loading. Only doing so because I took a few days off work.
Eldenring,ItIsKevin,"Taking control of Genichiro during his search for The Black Mortal Blade. He could need Tomoe in memory like how Wolf traveled to Hirata, and the level design could complement having a bow as opposed to a grappling hook, or maybe the bow could act like the grappling hook by firing an arrow with a rope or something."
Eldenring,caffeineevil,"Yeah but the trade off is you are in the danger zone with the sword. Both require a degree of tactics.

Sword: I can swing infinitely but I need to pay close attention to make sure I'm not murdered.

Magic: I only have a certain number of spells so I need to make them count but at least I'm not being hit."
Eldenring,Sikosh,"OMG, this would be sick! What if there were 2 versions? A glintstone one and a meteor version? :O"
Eldenring,QKsilver58,Well that's for BB1 right? Did they pay for a single game or the entire BB franchise?

Just let us play together ffs.

I was kinda alright with it in Dark Souls since it fit the plot, but ever since every ""Souls-like"" in existence thinks that janky half-functioning multiplayer is part of the experience. From needs to make a Souls-like without that feature so the copycat developers will realize that's not what makes a Souls game what it is."
Eldenring,Hiruko251,"Allaround oolacile, the black goo in some places making a way"
Eldenring,harrythechimp,No fucking way...
Eldenring,Alexcoolps,"What is the origin of the dragons heritage?
Where did the mortal blades come from?
Where was Genichiro after his first defeat? thanks"
Eldenring,Sikosh,"I think we get pot boy instead, but is it really pot boy or just patches hiding in a pot?"
Eldenring,dynamicflashy,"I would‚Äôve agreed with this in 2019 or 2020. But too much time has passed and Sekiro, even without a real expansion, will remain a certified classic."
Eldenring,Mishar5k,"Yea, not 60fps but still better than the original"
Eldenring,BroomBender,"I never said I'm complaining, just that that's most likely the case"
Eldenring,ItIsKevin,"Where did Genichiro get The Black Blade? That was my thought an expansion/dlc could have been. Could have added a slightly different moveset and the bow. Who knows, and he could have met Tomoe in memory like Wolf did Hirata."
Eldenring,caffeineevil,I found the center point of my tv where the spells hit and put a white dot so I could manually aim with the binoculars. Can't remember if it helped without them
Eldenring,all-that-is-given,Thanks.
Eldenring,Dolormight,"I'll pre-order ER the day before just so I can pre load. That's it, that's my only reason to ever pre order. Pretty much only for this game though. Had some time off to burn so I burned it for ER."
Eldenring,GhostSider690,Try slowly going through the swamp without using the dagger. You would be surprised of  how immersive the experience actually is.
Eldenring,real_Lejon_Brames,You are getting a whole new game instead of a dlc to the old one. Even if Elden Ring hindered the development of Sekiro dlc the trade of is much better. I understand you may like Sekiro more than Dark Souls or Elden Ring but statistically speaking 10hours (which dlc usually are) of content vs hundreds of hours is bad
Eldenring,harrythechimp,Oh yeah! The beast cutter before it was the beast cutter!
Eldenring,Hiruko251,"In your mind maybe, beat the game up to ng+3 with the cane as my main, then focused on other weapons"
Eldenring,CompuuterJuice,Sekiro isn‚Äôt a souls game

Eldenring,Skeletor9000,Sekiro didn't
Eldenring,Jamies_awesome_rack,"Kicking. Not the shield break kick from Souls games. I want leaping in the air, heel droppin, roundhouse your fuckin‚Äô head off Senpou MAN kicks.

Eldenring,Siero_Vevo,"The only thing I'm concerned about is the PC requirement, which still hasn't be published :("
Eldenring,Dolormight,"I've seen people be against pre ordering for years before that debacle. Mostly came down to exclusive pre order content that was actually included on the disk but wasn't activated without a pre order code. Was mostly just shooters being guilty of it for a bit, but it's rampant now. The unfinished games is just companies pushing it to its limit."
Eldenring,Anarchideous,"It got something more of an update rather than a DLC, cause it is integrated in the base game and not listed separately."
Eldenring,SuperdaveOZY,"Im sure Sekiro did not get DLC because alot of people who bought it, returned it a few days later after a fit of parry induced rage."
Eldenring,AbsoluteSereniti,Now Imagine doing SL1 run. (Where all optional bosses including dlc bosses are required).

Eldenring,Akira_Arkais,"Now it will feel more organic, they'll be able to create realistic environments, a Castle won't have to end on a backdoor leading to a swamp or a dungeon that will end in a city with one way to the next point.

Eldenring,Imatworkreadonly,"FOUR fucking forms.

*FOUR!*"
Eldenring,judomadonna,Naaah
Eldenring,TheoriesOfEverything,I'd bet a decent amount ER is gonna have a stamina bar again so posture is sort of at odds with the stamina system.  Would be cool to have a weapon like a katana be a nod to Sekiro with a weapon art that allowed you to do a short guard window though.  Pretty sure it would still have to cost some stamina or whatever the equivalent of FP is though.  Though also they've mentioned allowing you to move weapon arts so I don't know if that'd work--here's hoping cause I also really liked the swordplay in Sekiro.
Eldenring,lithops_slowshy,"Miyazaki is legit masochist, it won't happen unless Kadokawa sell FS to some Western company."
Eldenring,07Days,There will never be an easy mode
Eldenring,Simwill_,"Maybe just like a Pyromancer class Rune that you start with but you can collect Knight, rogue, cleric, sorcerer  (etc) runes later on to equip freely and gain the respective bonuses."
Eldenring,MiyazakisBurner,"Its 7 fucking games. Out of thousands. The 7 games combined likely havent sold even 50 million copies. Some games have twice that in their per week playerbase. one developer can be allowed to do what the fuck they want. If they want to add options to make it easier, they have. They might add more. I will say, they lack alot of actual accessibility options, not ‚Äúi cant be fucked to try and learn how to play‚Äù modes."
Eldenring,Hyulquen,COUNTER-SLASH from Sekiro for sure.
Eldenring,Simwill_,"Combos are really fun but unfortunately so far in all the games, just spamming r1 to stunlock the enemy is way more effective. They need to find a way to make mixing attacks deal more DPS than just boringly spamming r1."
Eldenring,Tr3v0r007,Actually if I‚Äôm not mistaken they said something like ‚Äúwe may not have city‚Äôs but we have plenty of things like side quest‚Äù this is just a rough draft of the quote but Ik they said something similar
Eldenring,Simwill_,The many Boss vs Boss and Enemy vs enemy modded videos there are have proven that Soulsborne enemies are incredibly entertaining to see fight one another
Eldenring,loddedfun,"Sekiro had a cool af underwater area, I hope speed swimming is a thing"
Eldenring,udreif,A place with narrow tunnels that make certain weapons almost always bounce off the walls
Eldenring,RoiKK1502,‚ÄúMy fetus just beat Bell Gargoyles and I couldn‚Äôt be happier‚Äù
Eldenring,Historical-Author-49,"I expect that too. If they take anything from Sekiro I'm expecting it to be that sense of a dynamic environment. We know there will be world events going on, they've talked about it a bit. Miyazaki also referenced something about the state of the Elden ring changing the world. I'm hoping this means that major events that you do can alter areas of the world"
Eldenring,NinjaSwag_,Great fucking game
Eldenring,thekingdtom,"God I hope so. I also loved revisiting Ashina Castle in Sekiro and seeing what changed, and I bet we‚Äôll see a lot more of that kind of thing in Elden Ring, too."
Eldenring,Scyxurz,I would feel like using anything other than what I started building towards would be a waste. Might as well start a new character if I wanna switch at that point.
Eldenring,MeMeBigBoy875,Make it like sekiro and tie them behind boss gauntlets. I'm usually pretty indifferent to purely cosmetic items but having to git gud at sekiro and Beat the gauntlets made the skins you get so much more meaningful. I'd rather have like three really cool skins tied behind extreme gameplay challenges then just simple recolors kind of like the stuff you see in games like apex.
Eldenring,SolaPhobophobia,From always does the post-apocalyptic setting because they‚Äôre not confident in their ability to make living cities and shit like that. I think they hinted at something like at for a later game though. Perhaps Elden Ring 2?
Eldenring,SolaPhobophobia,I‚Äôm actually better at Sekiro than I am at Dark Souls so I‚Äôm really hoping they put the posture system into the game for some weapons.
Eldenring,BuiltToAnnoy,I'm guessing we will be getting an erdtree area- maybe its the hub or end game location.
Eldenring,motionScientist,"Code Vein had the perfect opportunity to do this, but didn't and it has been disappointing ever since"
Eldenring,dkc_souls,"You think that‚Äôs crazy, look up ‚ÄúFeudal Japan‚Äù and see what weapons they came up with after maining dex once"
Eldenring,Goldpan2,there is another
Eldenring,mhcadchen,Those areas and bosses are pretty fucked up but the way they presented in ivory king fight as an 8 people raid is still a good touch to me.
Eldenring,nawlins49,It is too weak to run anything past Dark Souls 2.
Eldenring,burrito_bisen,"Nioh does a really solid job at this imo, it would be cool to see the Miyazaki games tackle it."
Eldenring,HAK987,Sister friedes feet give me nightmares. Bitch keeps jumping around
Eldenring,TheGreyDestroyer7,"But it‚Äôs just a bonus to a damage type, not a reduction to anything else? You could still use other items just as well."
Eldenring,gameg805,"Here's my idea that's sort of similar to yours.

Parrying with a sword is easier to execute but only opens the enemy up and does not allow for a riposte, whereas a shield will be more difficult but rewarding because it would give you a riposte."
Eldenring,HAK987,The sound of those swords clashing is like music to my ears
Eldenring,peon125,dragon
Eldenring,soulofsisterfriede,That's good advice. That's why I'm throwing away the entirety of DS2 as soon as I'm done playing.
Eldenring,HAK987,No that's friendship you buy
Eldenring,Lolipopes,Soulmemory omegalul
Eldenring,marsgreekgod,I would hate that i Iove feeling free to use weapons.
Eldenring,gameg805,Like in ds3 but toned down to the point where you need to keep your guard up but it's doesn't happen every time to the point where you expect it.
Eldenring,Historical-Author-49,I have a suspicion that you'll get your wish in Elden Ring. I have a theory that the six demi gods in ER might be at odds with each other at some points or you may be able to pick a side with one against another. I think Sekiro was a step forward for FromSoftware in having enemies that fight each other and I think we might see the evolution of this in Elden Ring
Eldenring,PJ_Ammas,30fps easily. 60fps likely
Eldenring,PJ_Ammas,Genius. Then I can use the tank as a sort of tray for my comic books and chocolate milk!
Eldenring,Volcano-SUN,"Crosshair for long ranged spells.

Eldenring,Historical-Author-49,I hope Elden Ring has Mikiri counter
Eldenring,Fleffle,I doubt we could even imagine it.
Eldenring,Volcano-SUN,So... Firebombs?
Eldenring,otakuloid01,that‚Äôs just covenants
Eldenring,otakuloid01,that‚Äôs how the optional areas in the DS2 DLCs happened are you sure you want The Lands Between to feature a Horsefuck Valley
Eldenring,otakuloid01,"i bet if Elden Ring gets DLC, it‚Äôll *still* be like ‚Äúgo touch this thing in some arbitrary location to get Loading Screen‚Äôd into the DLC area‚Äù"
Eldenring,thejoker00007,"I think there is statue feet in the trailer, will that we ok until the game is released."
Eldenring,new_messages,"I remember when I first played Oblivion as a teen I did literally everything else before the main quest, DLCs included, but never really had a companion follow me. I don't remember if I didn't want them to die, or just wanted to play solo.

Then on the final quest I called up a companion from every major or minor quest, threw down a couple of conjuration spells, and went ahead past the point of no return.

...it slowed down my computer quite a bit, and it was pretty anticlimactic considering there aren't really that many enemies, they are the same you can find in any oblivion gate, and you are supposed to just walk around the one boss-like angry giant red man rather than fight him."
Eldenring,YuRedTis,i know it‚Äôs open world and all but from software has incredible compression capabilities. i wouldn‚Äôt doubt them

Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,I know this is a joke but I high key wouldn't mind a more interactive experience with the NPCs besides questlines that end in basically nothing or them dying and you get a cool item.
Eldenring,VivaLaKitten,yeah nice
Eldenring,Nuclear_TeddyBear,This is the way
Eldenring,killerdonut0610,They‚Äôve literally already said that the game will have souls combat and that‚Äôs how it looks in the trailer and the leaks. It‚Äôs not gonna be like Sekiro and all these posts about it are getting really repetitive.
Eldenring,FriedeOfAriandel,I was very whelmed by the announcement until I realized that I could have the whole soulsborne library on the go. I adore my switch and would do unspeakable things to have just dark souls 2 and 3 on there to round out the trilogy
Eldenring,Crylyte,"I think you can use it in invasion / co-op sessions, it just doesn't freeze the game as it would if you were playing alone"
Eldenring,Single_Ad_9455,"Squad Battles. Basically just like a massive number of players going at in Arena mode. Think 5v5s at least, or bigger."
Eldenring,twinborntax1,Lol it‚Äôs not like that. Winning anything in life never really brings me joy. All I can think is that this is what I was supposed to do to begin with and that I‚Äôm a fucking loser for not succeeding the first time. Very unhealthy but that‚Äôs just how it is.
Eldenring,Simwill_,Shields and blocking are definitely in the game but I hope they include the sekiro deflect in some form. It‚Äôs really satisfying

Eldenring,Zen_Hydra,"I would like to see unique open world events which show up on certain times, dates, and circumstances...but in a uniquely From Soft way (and not in the grotesque EA/Activision/Ubisoft manner).

More than that, I would love for new areas to be regularly added to the game as just new connections from the open world. I have wanted a regularly expanding Soulsborne experience for a long time. I know it must be incredibly difficult to mix the carefully measured and curated combat experiences From is known for with the notion of an open world which can be navigated in near countless ways, but that is what the petrified something I have in place of a heart truly desires."
Eldenring,thekingdtom,"I really liked the war-torn areas in Sekiro, where you could walk into a conflict between groups of enemies. Ever since then, I‚Äôve hoped for a game that lets you enter a battlefield. The Abyss Watchers fight in DS3 was a pretty good taste of that, but I want to see it on a much bigger scale. 

Post-apocalyptic is cool, but I‚Äôm tired of seeing bones and dying gods. I want to see some fresh meat, damn it."
Eldenring,kneadd,"Like with every souls-like game i will make Daddy, the hottest man possible. His build changes depending on what is more fun in the specific game, but it's usually either a magic user or a pure strength build with little to no armor."
Eldenring,tower_knight,"most likely only one of the composers. Besides DeS and DS1, the other games including sekiro has had multiple composers"

Eldenring,kakomamushi,"Lmao unfinished, the legendary trademark of souls games"
Eldenring,Gundam_Greg,"It‚Äôs a good 80‚Äôs movie. So with that said, it takes a lot of liberties and the best part in my opinion is the spider part."
Eldenring,Doobiedoo96,Ohhh elden ring!!!?
Eldenring,ColonelSanderss1,I just hope we have options like maybe a sword in the game has a certain Moveset to do sekiro style blocking and deflecting and also more classical Dark souls style sword and shield stuff. Also maybe new systems of horse combat would be cool.
Eldenring,Blizaaaaaaaaaard,No thanks for bosses designed for multiple people

Eldenring,quakerpuss,"It is weird that so many people gravitated to her when she shows up less than any of the other firekeeper esque characters in the series. If she had been at the roundtable hold or at every grace I could see the connection, but this every 10th grace once in a time chats made her a forgettable character. There was no bond or kinship between the player and her to be fostered, if fromsoft wanted you to care about sacrificing her they should've put her around more.

Arguably the flame of frenzy ending made me like her a bit more, and I hope that gets expanded on."

Eldenring,Suitable-Tank127,"Maybe it's too late for this but when you see Rykard doing his fireball spam thing, just run around the corners of the circular arena. Don't even look at him. Just keep on running; the fireballs will eventually stop. Your signal is when the ""sky"" isn't red anymore."

Eldenring,ArchangelAzrael_910,Not even just new people having trouble. My cousin and his friend both had trouble fighting him together. Even thought they had slash weapons and one of them had magic. Googled if he got nerfed to see if he did since I've been lagging behind in terms of progress. Come to realize they were just bitches after I finally reached him and it took no more than 5 tries. It shocked me too cause they are just as experienced as I am if not more. I think people are just being dumb.

Eldenring,Sufficient_Damage_76,I ended my first play through at level 90 lmao now I have a joke character who's level 264 and im just gonna keep leveling him more and more stay mad doesnt affect me at all ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Eldenring,GingerGerald,"It's not 'cheating'. It'll make the game easier and probably make it harder to match for PvP, but it's not 'cheating'; it's heavily stacking the deck in your favor, but it's not cheating."
Eldenring,Mrixl2520,"I have played tons of games where I have to poke a 100 foot tall god to death with a magic sword, but I have only played one game where I could beat a demon by throwing toxic poo over a wall."
Eldenring,cosmopaladin,"Well that's true until you do the dlc content on high NG+, or do the FRC Chalice dungeons. Then everything straight up 1 shots you or puts you at 10% health if you have soft capped vigor (50). You can't just use the rally mechanic to win in some FRC Chalice dungeons because at no point does anything do less than 1 shot damage.

Also rally is based on what weapon you use. Some weapons are so bad it the mechanic might as well not exist. You probably just happened to pick and use a weapon that had really good rally.

Bloodborne is also just tuned to be very easy on NG. When you start getting to the higher NG+ cycles the game really changes. I think the intention is to encourage the player to spend time in chalice dungeons while allowing you to skip them in NG. Then in high NG+ you actually need the best gems from FRCs. Chalice dungeon progress is not reset by NG+, and it doesn't get harder. Which is why FRCs are insanity hard. They are easily the hardest content in the game. Maybe NG+4-NG+7 (the cap) dlc is as hard?"
Eldenring,chud69,You can use each masoleum once is my understanding. The two that are bugged for me have not been used.
Eldenring,raistmaj,"Man, I have a madness rot bleed build, and is either I kill the boss in 30 seconds while the mimic tanks it or I get one shot (ng+7). The only bosses I actually had to fight are the last two because of the immunities."

Eldenring,Aiur16899,Interesting. Man I gotta slow my roll on figuring this game out.
Eldenring,the_gifted_Atheist,If there was nobody using the Bloody Finger then there would be nothing to do with the Taunter's Tongue.
Eldenring,StickWelded,"Had it frequently on my attempts, where if I didn't skip the cutscene she'd 'activate' before I was given control back. My first attempt I literally loaded into the game from her cutscene to her literally mid-swing on my face.  


My rig passes the recommended specs too, and it's on a NVME drive to boot. Just a thing that happens. Skip the cutscene after the first time."
Eldenring,Cwest5538,"It isn't the only way to get arcs. You can get them from co-op, and they drop from enemies. Co-op also gives you runes and it's actively engaging with the game as opposed to essentially abusing an unintended glitch to be a dick and waste people's time. It's also the intended way to play lmao."

Eldenring,testspecimen85,Why would they do that when they can release a remaster for PS5 and then port it to pc?
Eldenring,Thecristo96,"For me gael was like this. In the end we were just two undead clashing their greatswords in the middle of the desert, with nothing more than our sheer willpower"
Eldenring,Some-Scheme838,"Game just simply is not optimized yet for pc from what I‚Äôve heard unfortunately. I play on ps4 and get little drops here and there but have kinda just had to learn to deal with it, it‚Äôll get better with time it already has since release"

Eldenring,Vocong01,"I‚Äôve kinda noticed that when I put my points into dex, my damage doesn‚Äôt change by much. Although, I have been increasing my health and it‚Äôs quite beneficial in not getting two shotted by the big knights in the castle"

Eldenring,leninist_jinn,"If you feel like you're still overlevelled when you're at Altus Plateau, before doing the capital, go do the volcano manor questline. Make sure you have spoken to Rya the scout in Liurnia before you step into the manor though. At the end of her quest she will give you an item that increases damage you take without boosting anything."
Eldenring,poknyingi,No problem! And once you reach liurnia you'll start leveling up much faster so there is no need to worry
Eldenring,YRUZ,there's a tear for your wondrous physick that nullifies all fp costs for a few seconds.
Eldenring,RandomStaticThought,"Baxter from anchor man, he got into the fridge, at the whole wheel of cheese and his master says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even mad.‚Äù Because it was so impressive. Shooting this dude through a tiny hole in a wall is definitely impressive."
Eldenring,Peter_Pancakes_,"Unfortunately, not that I have seen...As another has mentioned, the Troll Knight's sword has a similar set, with a couple of differences...But even at 99 dex 50 str and 50 intelligence, the damage is quite disappointing, compared to others. I'm fairly upset about the selection of greatsword / colossal sword movesets. Each weapon seems to be a carbon copy of the next with the exception of weapon arts. It is very disheartening to have more than a dozen different greatswords in my inventory and literally nothing to set each apart from one another. Don't worry, though,...If your preference is blood loss, Fromsoftware has you covered. I think it is safe to say that the Japanese designers have shown a great deal of favor to Japanese style blades."

Eldenring,MyNameIsHurb,?
Eldenring,AnalysticEnthusiast,"I prefer the quantity. Also, in previous games, there were dozens and dozens of weapons viable for endgame PvP.

The reason there aren't in ER right now is because they haven't released all the balance patches yet. Rest assured there will be greater weapon/build diversity after some stuff gets nerfed/buffed."

Eldenring,Mimical,"Yeah, you can do It like I did and spend 2 days getting utterly beat to hell and back before finally squeezing through the battle looking like a half dead corpse yourself."
Eldenring,UnofficialMipha,Why am I not the least bit surprised. I‚Äôm actually more surprised this wasn‚Äôt brought to my attention sooner
Eldenring,Successful_Addiction,"We don‚Äôt actually get the great rune, Renallas shard is in the egg.

Eldenring,FelisImpurrator,"I'm just mad the one place to powerlevel is gated behind the thing that disincentivizes powerleveling. Like... Dude, really?

I don't do invasion stuff as a rule. I don't like the idea of gank or be ganked. So I just take my weapons off and gesture with memes before indicating I want to get bonked to death ASAP by punching someone bare handed.

This time, if I can get matches, I will be buck naked and unarmed with nothing but the legendary Goldmask T-pose."
Eldenring,flipperkip97,"I think it looks pretty cool. Downloading the demo right now.

I don't understand why From fans are always so hostile and negative towards other games."
Eldenring,flipperkip97,I'm pretty sure Fromsoft is big enough to decide when they're going to show off the trailer. There's nothing Bamco can do if From doesn't supply them with footage.

Eldenring,flipperkip97,This but unironically...

Eldenring,whlpr,then he'll be oversaturated
Eldenring,JayTrenton,"That's what i'm saying the whole year: ER won't be shown at E3, there won't be any news this year. FS is stuck in an infnite cycle of polishing and fixing. They announced it way too earley and there was never an intention to release it in 2020. Expect an 2022 Fall release at earliest or even 2023. If they stay silent for another year, they can cancel it. Poeple start forgetting it and loosing more and more interest and if they finnally show it, there will be much disappointment and well earned disinterest. Who cares about a game, announced years ago from an company that just vanished into silence? Yeah i get it, they have their fans and their reputation, but this won't last forever if they just ignore their fans for another one or two years. 

You can only hope that Bamco or their investor will force them to release this dumpster fire or add pressure at least. But don't forget about Duke Nukem Forever, The Last Guardian or Daikatana. Vaporware is always shit and the leaked trailer proofs this imo. 

The wohle ER dumpster fire thing is not typical for FS and this is a bad sign, this game is in trouble and just staying silent and trying to fix it, won't change much. You can't turn shit into gold. You should hope they cancel it or start over, FS behaives like a shitty company with a broken shitty mess in the making. Staying ignorant and silce could be interpreted as a sign of shame i bet they piss themselfes and are just too scared show their shitty little Dark Syrim Ring."
Eldenring,Rhaps0dy,He's too powerful
Eldenring,BigBlubberyBirb,"if we get an exceptionally large amount of new footage, will we be able to return to miyazaki?"
Eldenring,Swatyo,It's a good thing you're not doing it until the winds of winter is released.
Eldenring,Grizzly_228,Quick question are you applying the grey from 7% of the original image or 7% of the most recent iteration?
Eldenring,abhinay33,Well it better be the second coming of God because 5 years of development time is too much .
Eldenring,Auzquandiance,Can Miyazaki be more transparent after he disappeared?
Eldenring,MothPreacher,***N O.***

Eldenring,Darkbornedragon,Yeah it sounds like something a Japan studio would never do for anyone
Eldenring,Darkbornedragon,"Basically Dragon Bone Smasher. Scirvir has a dialogue about it which reminds of that line in a way 

(In Demon's Souls)"
Eldenring,OYoureapproachingme,"Still you're gonna have some asshats say that Berserk references in Soulsborne are overstated. Like bro every single game has made very clear references/allusions/ drawn inspiration from Berserk
Miyazaki has even said he's been inspired by Berserk. The themes of both DS and Berserk are similar in nature"
Eldenring,OYoureapproachingme,Of course this receives the wholesome award
Eldenring,abhinay33,Nah just because a game is having more development time doesn't necessarily makes it good and with from soft that's a red flag.
Eldenring,bastardo-bloodvial,"On serious note-


Is that same? I am pretty sure that one was fake dm."
Eldenring,Nightmare_Rage,"Doesn't seem like FromSoft's style. They're more likely to bury it so deep that it takes years to uncover, haha."
Eldenring,bastardo-bloodvial,He is too strong for you
Eldenring,ErNhiz,Which one was the hardest to get in your opinion?
Eldenring,bastardo-bloodvial,"It is weekly though. And what should we do  for a non existing game?


Besides I also hate this subreddit superiority some have. (It is a phenomenal all over reddit) It is just stupid."
Eldenring,Fraudu-Kun,should be able to. you would have to look up a sega dreamcast emulator and snag the rom from somewhere but by now im sure the dreamcast emulator exists
Eldenring,CrunchyConniptions,It has to be... unless... no no no... it can‚Äôt be! Have I been fooled into betraying my sun bros!?
Eldenring,Gamer60234,Are you sure the moonlight greatsword you get by betraying the warriors of sunlight is real? The real one might be with someone else

Eldenring,bastardo-bloodvial,Yes :)
Eldenring,Competitive-Row6376,"Hellpoint is basically that. But if FromSoft tries something like it, it would probably be better"
Eldenring,CrunchyConniptions,But will I still get moonlight great sword. I heard this is the only way.
Eldenring,Nadam_Teufel,well I'm not gonna fix it. it adds to the credibility
Eldenring,CounterSniped,What do we say to the God of Death?
Eldenring,Gamer60234,"You don't actually need to betray the warriors of sunlight to get the ending, I'll give you a little hint, give the old hermit in the crumbling tower a faint moonlight stone"

Eldenring,Redeaglbeaver2,Not really but he wasn't so slow as the comments suggest [https://i.redd.it/nmselm3oceu41.png](https://i.redd.it/nmselm3oceu41.png) this is the graph of berserk releases Now you are gonna say wow in 2013 he only released 1 chapter it's because he was working on another manga Gignato and in 2019-2020 he was working on another manga duranki he isn't that slow also we got 3 chapters in 2020 iirc so yeah he was slow but he wouldn't take a year to release a single chapter.

Eldenring,piganged,RIP
Eldenring,abhinay33,Yeah but you said that the game isn't being shown because it's not ready yet. It's clearly ready to be shown and it's just from and bandai being lazy at this point because they know other people are doing all the marketing on their behalf. Bandai is hence focusing on promoting it's other so called weeb games.
Eldenring,mynewdrip,"Phil didn‚Äôt play ‚Äúa significant‚Äù part of it. He played it. That‚Äôs it . E3 is in 3 weeks and we haven‚Äôt heard anything about the game being at e3. We always hear rumours prior to e3, but now it‚Äôs radio silence. Even if the game would be shown at e3 , there would be no way for a 2021 release. It‚Äôs gonna be summer or fall 2022"
Eldenring,abhinay33,"Bs ,how did Phil Spencer play a significant part of it then? It might not be ready to release yet but surely is far enough in development to be shown ."
Eldenring,TheFinalMetroid,"Ah, the one true God... and Satan"
Eldenring,Then_Ad_6432,"&gt;all without berserk the from games wouldnt be the same

I think there are still a lots of things to inspire in berserk series. So Miyazaki doesnt need new berserk chapters."
Eldenring,mynewdrip,Elden ring will bring way more money than those weeb games. The reason that there‚Äôs no info about elden ring is simply because the game isn‚Äôt finished or ready to be shown yet. I‚Äôm excepting fall 2022.
Eldenring,abhinay33,"I know coz bandai is too busy with weeb games , also this game has release date of 25 June , why would they show elden ring at E3 to take the attention off of this ."
Eldenring,Xeno_of_Cinders,"""elden ring is a physical object"", it's fake."

So they get balls thrown all outside the strike zone over and over and get walked more than any guy in the bigs.  So yeah, they‚Äôre gonna wait for their pitch.

You‚Äôre Barry Bonds in the 9th inning walkin up to the plate and the bases are loaded, 2 outs.  I don‚Äôt blame you for believing this nervous pitcher is gonna throw balls all over the place and refusing to swing, but shit man, he really would love to strike you out.  So he‚Äôs gotta get you to swing.  You‚Äôve seen every trick pitch tryin to fool you into swinging at garbage a million times before, everyone tries to get you, and yeah you‚Äôve struck out a bunch chasing balls.  But as a result, you‚Äôve gotten good at waiting for your pitch.

I‚Äôm wheezing! NO. SHUT THE FUCK UP. Nobody cares about your shitty comic series. Dio is a stupid character from a stupid comic series.

Sekiro is the one Fromsoft game I can say that was never bad. It never really excelled above all other games in any category, but it is by far the most consistent experience"
Eldenring,braiman02,"Yeah. 

With rolling I think they should just nerf it really hard. Make it so that you can do it but you have to roll/dodge away from attacks intelligently rather than into them using iframes. And use your sword to parry ala Sekiro otherwise. 

Same thing with shields. Use your shield to block and maybe implement some sort of perfect blocking mechanic. 

For casters I have no idea what they could do but they have to do something as the gameplay for casters has always been mediocre at best."
Eldenring,fantalas,"It's said that the combat will build much more on DS3 rather than Sekiro (Xbox interview, Omni).

While I would love Sekiro's combat to return in any capacity, I can see why it would too huge of a task to replicate a combat system similar to Sekiro in an RPG setting, accommodating all the different weapons, spells, armors and playstyles that Sekiro didn't have.

That said I still hope that the VFX/UX, fluid movement and animations will return from Sekiro's combat if nothing else."
Eldenring,braiman02,"You have a point I was saying this on the DS2 subreddit just yesterday. I just played as a tank in DS2 and it was quite fun. The build may not be optimal but it was definitely very viable and different. The poise system and better armor meant that I was barely taking damage (if they could even get past my greatshield) and never got interrupted. 

Coming back to DS3 today, everything feels so much worse than rolling and spamming R1 with an OP weapon. 

Admittedly its a problem with Bloodborne too, though it doesnt look as ridiculous as the roll. 

I think they've gone in a really positive direction with Sekiro and I hope they can build on that to offer variety."
Eldenring,Ancientrelic7,"Good luck, I hope you don't get robbed(I'm not joking, that happens), the Demon Souls remake looks incredible so enjoy."
Eldenring,rogerthealien17,"I think it's pretty likely, going from sekiro's combat to mostly a ""dodge, hit, dodge"" playstyle would come across as regressive. FromS got huge acclaim for the fighting mechanics and seems logical they would expand on it. 

You do raise a good point about what implementations they could make with arcane builds"
Eldenring,Smallsey,If it expires can we as a subreddit buy it?
Eldenring,braiman02,"&gt;AND the possibility of a combat mechanics on par with the company's predecessor?

I hope so. But Sekiro had one playstyle while Dark Souls games typically had 3 (magic, rolling melee, tank melee), and variations of those three. So I really wonder how they will flesh out those 3 well enough that they are on par with Sekiro's combat."
Eldenring,braiman02,Perhaps I misunderstood what you said.

#BIG POISON SWAMP"
Eldenring,braiman02,"Alright, fair point and I could buy that Bloodborne or DS3 may be better representations of soulslike than DS1. (I don't actually think thats the case at all, but its an acceptable opinion.)

Sekiro on the other hand imo diverges from all those other games considerably. Whether you personally consider it an evolution of the genre or not is irrelevant. OP is making a list of what game is the most soulslike. That means what we are reviewing is which game fits best with the gaming communities collective understanding of what a Souls game is. I don't think that people would consider Sekiro to be the best example of it, considering it has no weapons, no armors, no stat allocation, no character creation etc. It diverges heavily from the other games that From Software made (including Elden Ring from what we know) and all the Souls Likes that exist (except Fallen Order). The allocation of new prosthetics and the progression system are closer to Hollow Knight aka metroidvania.

And you know, if in 10 years Souls Likes are more influenced by Sekiro's design than Dark Souls, I'll say hey you have a point. But right NOW? Sekiro is a new game that hasn't had the same level of influence on characterizing the genre that Dark Souls did. Yes there is innovation, but the impact of innovation doesn't *immediately* change what a genre is."

not that he saw it in before.

Eldenring,marsgreekgod,He didn't say that? I'm confused
Eldenring,lwo-owl,Think you're reading a little too deep there comrade
Eldenring,CageBomb,I mean there's endless Bloodborne fanart out there that's loyal to FromSoft's Victorian artstyle. Can't we appreciate fanart that takes things in an unexpected direction? Or at least not act weirdly aggressive towards it?
Eldenring,Waycool499,I aim to please üòé
Eldenring,chillyboy456,you calling any of these games spin-offs makes want to rip your eyes out with an ice cream scooper just so that you cant see the release of Elden Ring
Eldenring,TheMasterSwordMaster,Laugh if you want but we got confirmation [as recent as February ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/mxaoep/bandai_namco_interview_from_february_8_2021_they) that they still plan on releasing it.
Eldenring,nogills,seeing this whole thread a bit late. i am here to confirm you are in fact the idiot in the thread
Eldenring,bananaface301,Why do you touch the screen so much?
Eldenring,silentravens,So did Phil Spencer

Eldenring,TheMasterSwordMaster,"If elden ring even has a hub it'd probably be disconnected from the rest of the world like the nexus or hunters dream, Given its open world. I'm down for some sort of meditation that the player does that mentally transports them to it"
Eldenring,lostsoilder,"Wouldn't that make Demon Souls ""Old Dark Souls"""
Eldenring,TheMasterSwordMaster,"Hunters dream is pretty cool, I'm a fan of &gt;!how the final boss is fought within the hub area !&lt; 

but it's gotta be Majula for me. The music, how you bring the town back to life (more or less) with all the characters, the setpiece, atmosphere, and view, it's all sublime.

Imagine voting for the dilapidated temple. 4 npcs, 2 of which are there from the start of the game already and the others come very quickly, really lame placement, no cool view, claustrophobic a little bit as it's sitting in this crevice. I do like how there's a shortcut to it from senpou temple  though, as pointless as it may be."
Eldenring,timllesdust_x,Why do you think that?
Eldenring,CerealWithIceCream,how could they say megaman when metroid was the obvious inspiration for level design

Eldenring,testspecimen85,"If you‚Äôre a weeb, then that game already exists. It‚Äôs called Code Vein."
Eldenring,SirHoonter1,The hunters dream is probably my favourite place in all of video game history. The atmosphere and the music are absolutely incredible and such a beautiful sanctuary away from the blood and beasts.

Eldenring,AHeapOfBricks,This is Boomhammer erasure.
Eldenring,Svani,"There is a desert area in DS3, albeit small."
Eldenring,MaagicMushies,"Idk, it's a little different. There was nothing like doom before it came out. No genre besides ""action-y kinda???"" could describe it before the term first person shooter came around. The  Souls games, though are clearly just 3d action rpgs, but with enough quirks to blur the line. That's why I think the genre is never gonna have a proper name. Metroidvanias are clearly sidescrolling platformers, but with just enough different to make the name ""platformer"" insufficient, so it has to roll with a slightly cumbersome name and I feel like soulslikes will have to do the same."
Eldenring,Etticos,~~Big Dark Souls~~ Halted Dark Souls
Eldenring,AHeapOfBricks,"One of Lovecraft‚Äôs more prominent stories features a man journeying to an ancient city in the Desert, which likely inspired Ailing Loran. That‚Äôs probably what this artist is trying to depict.

Also, it‚Äôs only bright out in the sun. The protagonist enters the city proper and delves deep underground into cramped, pitch black, labyrinthine halls before he happens upon the true horror that lies beneath the desert sands.

Eldenring,Svani,"It's not that much smaller, Shadow of the Colossus was a pretty big hit that everybody and their mom were talking about when it released, and The Last Guardian's debut trailer was one of showstoppers of that year's E3. The hype was pretty real at the time.

One game that actually maintained its hype throughout several years of delays was Gran Turismo 5. And that's because they never shut up about it. The game was six months away from release for years, it became a meme basically, but the studio never stopped releasing info about it. Renders of a new track. Details on the modelling of the cars. Two demos. News that Sebastian Vettel was being brought in to provide test data (and then video of him doing so). When it released the hype was still through the roof.

Games like KH3, Duke Nukem Forever, The Last Guardian, Borderlands 3 and now ER just did a terrible job at keeping the flame alive."
Eldenring,JasoTheArtisan,‚ÄúIGN says Meg Man is the Bloodborne of platforming games‚Äù ‚Äî Rory Powers
Eldenring,zaid_sabah,But make sure to switch to your fists or else you might aggro a real NPC
Eldenring,Visible_Marsupial657,"I hope they have something like mimics in elden ring, really adds to the feeling of the game world being dangerous and trying to kill you in every way possible. Missed them in Bloodborne and Sekiro."
Eldenring,meammachine,Now we need mimic door.
Eldenring,WanderingCollosus,Ah so the Prey approach where anything can be an enemy but you don't know until it attacks you
Eldenring,Dksrkf,Then i would advise ds3 if you'd like to wrap up the ds story or bloodborne if you want fromsoftware at their absolute best
Eldenring,PthumerianPrince,"Hosts can be punished for healing, just from this comment I can tell you‚Äôre awful at DS3 pvp"

Eldenring,Tripledoble,True.
Eldenring,PthumerianPrince,Or maybe because those two are the best FromSoft games? Just a thought
Eldenring,WoodenPersonality974,"Maybe, but it could also just be like the duel blade weapons from 3. Maybe for this specific weapon they paired it with another."
Eldenring,Loyal_Darkmoon,"No, you can wield a weapon in each hand in every Dark Souls. Powerstance is the only thing exclusive to DkSII"
Eldenring,Tripledoble,Dual wielding is exclusive to Dark Souls 2.
Eldenring,zaid_sabah,"That's nice from you, thanks. I am  not drawing for the time being  because of incoming exams but I excited to get back to it when I am free again haha"
Eldenring,dark_hypernova,"Me too, maybe it will even revitalize the series to a proper ending this time."
Eldenring,Raime1995,You mean as in every Dark Souls
Eldenring,AlexzMercier97,"What it's just an ordinary NPC- 

OH MY GOODNESS!!"
Eldenring,AlexzMercier97,So excited to play that again
Eldenring,Ashen_Shroom,"Maybe it's different in ds3 then, it's been a while. I know that in DS1 anything you put in your left hand aside from a catalyst, talisman or pyro flame just blocks.

I feel like I tried left handing in ds3 and it didn't work, but it's been a while."
Eldenring,Curvanelli,"thatd be so awesome, sounds like it could be a DLC"

Eldenring,Johrny,I forgot all about that shield. Peak fashion souls
Eldenring,Elcordobeh,"Fucc you, may god shit on your blood line"
Eldenring,Accomplished-East635,"You can still attack with a weapon on your left, just not to the extend of how it does on your right. The amount of times I have seen people attack with two different weapons on ds3 is large, so power stance might‚Äôve been gone, but people still used two different weapons in each hand and made it work. Like I said, I wouldn‚Äôt mind it coming back, but have no problem if it doesn‚Äôt either"
Eldenring,RumDuckBot,"Did you mean, rumduck?     https://twitter.com/JamesFosdike/status/782911425249366016     https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDollop/comments/55hj28/the_dollop_209_john_macarthur_live_in_adelaide/"
Eldenring,0DrFish,"Okay but I've already said I don't think Sekiro is a Souls game - you can't use the item to describe its category - that's circular definition; ""Sekiro is a souls game because one of the Souls games is Sekiro, which is a souls game"".

I don't really understand your second point. You're basically saying if it was changed to conform to the rest of the Souls games, those changes aren't significant enough?  
I could say the same thing for any random turn based RPG - if they added action gameplay, it would be like a souls game, so it's clearly a souls game now.

You may not think RPG elements and weapon variety are important, but for myself and I'm sure many others they are critical; without them the Souls games would simply not be my favourite game series.

And I'm not saying you can't feasibly remove one or two elements without it still being a Souls game, of course you can, just like a Platypus is a mammal but lays eggs, but there is a limit, which I would say Sekiro crosses; to use a similar analogy, like if the platypus also had scales and gills."
Eldenring,Elcordobeh,Those look more like dogs since Ion see much fur in them
Eldenring,Elcordobeh,Norse or celtic. Its wolves or dogs deffinatedly
Eldenring,Ashen_Shroom,"The power stance mechanic itself doesn't need to come back, but if I put a weapon in my left hand it should actually work like a weapon. In DS1 and 3 (and DeS I think) if you put a weapon in your left hand you can only use it to block, which is really dumb."
Eldenring,[deleted],[removed]
Eldenring,Accomplished-East635,"I would prefer lockstone to be a key item, and for one to open multiple doors like someone here suggested, it would make more sense, except you don‚Äôt know which ones would be treasure, and which ones would be traps. Power Stancing didn‚Äôt have that big of an impact on me personally, I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with them coming back, but would be ok if they‚Äôre left out"
Eldenring,CandidateGuilty9831,"DS3 has a much kinder beginning In how it introduces the faster paced combat found in later souls games. That being said, play blood borne first.

The fun of the souls games comes from the difficulty and the world building. BB will probably be a shock to the system, but that‚Äôs the point. DS3 first might just dilute the joy of blood borne once you eventually play it.

I‚Äôm in the minority here, but I think the best fromsoft games are Sekiro and BB. 

I‚Äôd say Sekiro is better than DS3 and blood borne, but it‚Äôs very different than either. I‚Äôd leave it until last. It‚Äôs probably my fave"
Eldenring,Fukwhet,Needs a giant red arrow/circle to be a proper Easter egg pic.
Eldenring,CrackMcGuff,"The whole movie would be about the quest to find the Elden Ring, but a massively important story arc is about the Valkyrie lady impaling people and investigating why this is seen as paradise"
Eldenring,_srsh_,"i'd say ladder, chest, and bonfire mimics should be randomized"
Eldenring,grumpysnowflake,"Haven't played BB as I don't own PS. As to Ringed City, then as to level design I consider it to be on par with OIK. As to bosses: Gael is my favourite along with Owl Father in the From games. Fume and Alonne I like more than Princes and Midir, but I do prefer humanoid bosses over large ones. Blueberry was pure crap, though."
Eldenring,CrazyAnonymousGuy1,Condescending much?
Eldenring,Ashen_Shroom,DS3 forces you to use weapon pairs it puts together for you. That is a clear downgrade from being able to pair together any two weapons you want.
Eldenring,Accomplished-East635,"As a completionist, you would see my big issue with that, lol."
Eldenring,stamwisegamgee,I didn't say it looked worse?
Eldenring,Bierculles,Im pretty confident we will see some gameplay at gamescom
Eldenring,PthumerianPrince,"Dude it looks way better than in DS3, you blind mofo"
Eldenring,Ashen_Shroom,"Twin weapons are a terrible replacement. Why would I want to use premade pairs of weapons instead of pairing together any two weapons I want?

So your issue with pharros lockstones is that you can't farm them and that's why you don't want them back? Easy solution: make them farmable. It's not like they can't reimplement mechanics and improve on their flaws."

Eldenring,Rayz5,"Must be pretty close, all i know is i can't wait to play it."
Eldenring,Kvargen95,"I just finished ds2 for the first time and I think i have 40-45 hours for just that one run.
I enjoyed this game more then the other souls games because of how long it felt like, lots of variety in areas and once I thought i reached the end it was like halfway through. I did play it with dlc and did not rush anything, I took my time but i didnt spend any time on npc questlines or covenants. 
Bosses are mostly too easy but there are some challanges as well.

To me ds2= big dark souls"
Eldenring,edgyboi1704,*Your PotBoi has evolved into a Pot Noble*
Eldenring,ZenMacros,Doesn't need another trailer but I think we should get to see what the game actually looks like when played.
Eldenring,strayk98,"I m sad about that, because i can only play elden ring at June(5 months late)"
Eldenring,Ashen_Shroom,"The part of the castle we get to explore exists to deter people from seeking out Vendrick. It is basically Sen's Fortress- a bottleneck that only the strong can make it past. There are sealed doors near the start of the area which probably leave to the inhabitable parts.

Iron Keep is dumb but it's also an unfinished castle that is mostly sunk into lava. We're not exploring bits that were designed to be lived in for the most part.

Lost Bastille's design makes a lot of sense as a prison that was likely adapted from a royal palace of some kind going by the area's lore.

Aldia's Keep is the laboratory of a mad scientist. I can't think of anything there that doesn't make sense given the identity of the owner."
Eldenring,strayk98,"I personally wants it get delayed. January is really bad timing, most people free at summer. I m waiting for so long time, but i can play only at end of june"
Eldenring,Rayz5,Hope it will have some sort of Lifegem like item because it was kinda nice to use mid battles.
Eldenring,Departedsoul,Maybe a mimic tree or something like those ents in lotr
Eldenring,PthumerianPrince,"No one blindly trashed it, they had their reasons and very valid ones at that. You‚Äôre blindly ignoring very clear issues the game has for some mysterious reason"
Eldenring,BeWaryOfBackstepping,"Fair enough, I do prefer the more Euro medieval setup from souls myself but prefer the evolution of combat.  I think its pretty nice seeing combat arts but also traditional souls style gameplay in Elden ring"
Eldenring,Kombo_,"I'm keen on this!  
FF12's save crystals would actually sometimes be mimics! And holy shit would they fucking pound you to hell with all kinds of offensive spells. It's such a great idea!"
Eldenring,PthumerianPrince,Ambition doesn‚Äôt matter if the game feels like ASS to play lmao
Eldenring,Ashen_Shroom,The Iron King made the Iron Keep as a vanity project essentially. He probably didn't even intend to live in it.
Eldenring,Ashen_Shroom,In the case of Drangleic Castle it makes sense since the levels we explore were designed to make it hard to pursue Vendrick. It serves a similar purpose to Sen's Fortress-to make sure that anyone who makes it to Amana is strong enough to meet the king. The parts where Vendrick and Nashandra lived are probably behind the locked doors just past the entrance hall.
Eldenring,PthumerianPrince,"The Forbidden Woods would not fit in DS3, Jesus what are these takes I‚Äôm reading on this thread? Think about what you post people instead pulling nonsense out of your assholes"
Eldenring,MothPreacher,"now i want npc in ER, that swallows you like gluttony did, and you appear in different secret location. something like Gael's toilet paper, archdragon peak and cagey bois in undead settlement!"
Eldenring,PthumerianPrince,"You‚Äôre stretching it dude, wasn‚Äôt anything amazing especially the areas, full of annoying enemies coming out from every corner to gank your asshole. It‚Äôs a good DLC but nowhere near ‚ÄúThe Ringed City‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Old Hunters‚Äù levels of quality."
Eldenring,Shockle,They are dogs
Eldenring,DA_Str0m,I imagine it like the monsters book from Harry Potter
Eldenring,daryl_fish,Ohhh shoot. I forgot about the pool in drangleic. Though we were talkin about the keep lol
Eldenring,PthumerianPrince,"Smelter was garbage, what the hell was so ‚ÄúSoulsy‚Äù about him lmao"
Eldenring,PthumerianPrince,‚ÄúExcellent enemy/boss design‚Äù Are you serious dude? How someone can be this delusional is beyond me
Eldenring,Artyloo,Really? I consider Smelter one of my more hated boss of the series
Eldenring,okdude23232,I can't remember a single mid sekiro boss. Miniboss reuse was kinda bad but I  got used to it at some point
Eldenring,ZombieMaulie,Yeah sounds so dark compared to the official gameplay trailer. Miss kitamura will doing a great job like always

Eldenring,OneFortyTooLong,What about non-linear as hell and still make sense?
Eldenring,zaid_sabah,Lol i just now noticed the similarity
Eldenring,BeWaryOfBackstepping,"Damn, the ai concerning stealth is pretty trash but from boss design I lean more towards Sekiro than any other From games. There are a lot of dude with sword or spear fights yeah (rivaling DS2 for that distinction) but mostly the system of attack-parry-dodge seems much more fair.  Every death feels warranted unless swarmed by mobs and even then seems like there is much more flexibility with escape when you're clearing the trash 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I've had less phase thru portal and get stomped immediately in sekiro than I had in most other From ARPGs"
Eldenring,Curvanelli,"so gluttony from fma?

Eldenring,Bazooka944,"It better not get delayed :(( Although if they really need more time they should take it ofcourse , pandemic is still hitting hard in Japan from what I heard"
Eldenring,trenchwar42,I feel like a bonfire mimic is some kind of sin
Eldenring,ManjiSouls,I think you hit the nail on the head. Dark Souls 2 was much more ‚Äúvideo gamey‚Äù than the sort of immersive design in more modern games.
Eldenring,lagspike9107,DS2 prolly has the best replayability cos of how many different kind of builds you can do.
Eldenring,Dio_Thanos_Viola,Yas
Eldenring,Benji_0053,So... cookie the dog confirmed for elden ring?
Eldenring,di0_joestar,i can't wait guys... it feels like somethings gonna crawl out of me... I JUST CANT WAIT... i want to play this game
Eldenring,Prsy0220,Any day now
Eldenring,Interestng,Personally I think the hair is pretty good in Elden Ring  I'm basing that off on the full naked character model we see with the giant hand which also surprised me since the fharactwr model is very well textured and designed the helmet with long hair had some issues in the cutscenes but it looked very good in the in action gameplay
Eldenring,Ok_Estate_3354,"Trust me I‚Äôve beat all these games multiple times and thought about this subject for months. (being the big Quentin Tarantino fan that I am)
Only thing that connects the games are game design and Easter eggs that were put in each game by the same individuals. Patches is Miyazaki‚Äôs creation and only shows up in games that he does the main in-game writing for. (That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs not in DS2) Miyazaki wasn‚Äôt the main writer on Sekiro either and they said they considered involving patches but they couldn‚Äôt justify a patches character in that setting.
These are the only connections, anything else is head cannon until they write bridges.
To be fair I hope they don‚Äôt, having a interconnected multiverse is just a over convoluted way to make money on old IP when completely fresh ideas breath new life into their overly addictive game formula."
Eldenring,idkwhattonamethisra,Ok so it isn't just me then.Sekiro's graphics are way better than dark souls.In dark souls everything is black and 50 different shades of gray
Eldenring,BetonK,DS2 is good and fun to play
Eldenring,Kormit_the_Froggo,There will be no moonlight greatsword in Elden ring and you're all still in denial
Eldenring,haxborn,"I played pve for 100 hours, then you feel immortal, and repeating the same enemies but with higher health pool doesnt interest me. PvP is what kept me playing since then, exclusively, and I‚Äôm close to 1000 hours now!"

Eldenring,dianndycampsonyen,"This really makes it look not all that long, so thx."
Eldenring,_gibb,I mean they would still be a character that had meaning in the game‚Äôs progression since you‚Äôd still have to fight them for the first time. I think it‚Äôd be better if you could only replay once you beat the game

Eldenring,Vagrant_Isaiah,"""There should be in-game purchases of high tier weapons and items for the people who just want to experience the game without all the difficulty, Fromsoft needs to understand who the REAL players truly are."""

Eldenring,VoodooMoose-,Please god no.
Eldenring,OtterBadgerSnake,"I think the real question isn't ""will it be a good game?"" but rather it's ""how will this rank compared to the other FromSoftware games?""

I'm almost positive that this will be a good game.  Greatest game ever? GOTY? Best FromSoftware title yet?  Too early to tell if we're being honest with ourselves, but it most assuredly will be a good game."

To be fair, lvling also increases defense but still, a +10 armor makes a difference. And the 99 humanity, may seems crazy but then again, it does make a difference!"
Eldenring,rawgino,I really hope that becomes a mod
Eldenring,BoxStealingHobo,What if Elden ring won't have rings?
Eldenring,Jevling,We here for the gameplay. From Software games have never really been about the graphics. It's all about the art design and gameplay. üòÉ

Eldenring,--TreeTreeTree--,How many now..?
Eldenring,Ryanthehood,"PRESSSS ANY BUTTON!!! PLLEEEEEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD"
Eldenring,alpagator,"&gt;You're making too many based off very little there.

What are my assumptions here? Like genuinely, help me, what am I assuming?

Id count my assumptions to be; 

* the Demigods existed and were powerful before the shattering (this maybe goes slightly against stated lore)
* they are greedy and don't particularly like eachother already at that point (meta reasons, but drama makes for a better story than harmony, plus it's GRRM)

And I think that most of what I said is pretty much derived from those two main points, though of course with so little concrete knowledge anything we say will be filled with smaller assumptions and leaps of logic. But I think those 2 points are my main ones.

Whereas to me it seems you assume

* definite knowledge of who shattered the ER, and the motivation to break it
* Gods or other beings we haven't had any indication of
* insight to the nature of the ER (leaching energy from the outside world)"
Eldenring,asdf_TacoMaster,I think they want the gameplay reveal trailer (6.1M views) to have more views than the power rangers video (6.3M views)
Eldenring,fangdwelle,Maybe
Eldenring,Nethermoosen,"I agree. I don‚Äôt think it would feel right, to tell the truth. Even if it is just a video game."
Eldenring,joshua_you-ng,"Small crabs are crab. Big crabs are crabby. 

Crabs should be the source of mana in Elden Ring and they should bring a crab biome onto the map so we can feel immersed and truly free in the world of Crabben Cring."

Eldenring,GuytFromWayBack,I was supposed to be on a night shift but I managed to get it off. So I'll be up all night playing Elden Ring instead haha.
Eldenring,merayous,"If there isnt a porn site link, probably fake."
Eldenring,greatdeed,"&gt;I also don't have any solid information as to how From handled the pandemic/WFH internally (aside from the fact that they were in WFH mode in April/May 2020 and VGC's vague report), but it's clear they were slowed down regardless of if they juggled between regular and restricted development or not.

Really good breakdown. These state of emergencies didn't cause further delays every time they happened. The initial ones did for Japanese companies due to the big shift and adaptation to WFH. Everything after that the infrastructure was in place to handle any further SoE that would happen. Mid tier developers that operate mostly out of Japan like Platinum Games &amp; Fromsoftware were hit pretty hard while giant global corporations like Square Enix handled it a bit better (they still fell behind with like 6 months in their development pipeline according to their CEO)."
Eldenring,GuytFromWayBack,I think it's just because of the settings they pick. Like it doesn't make a lot of sense to just throw a desert level into a western European setting.
Eldenring,jojtek12,I need this! Link!
Eldenring,--TreeTreeTree--,"I think it was said earlier that a lot of what was shown is in one area, but some are from other areas."

Eldenring,HadesTheGrim,"I just don't agree, I feel like while everyone talking about this subject is making assumptions, including myself.... You're making too many based off very little there. I think that the blacksmith in the trailer broke the elden ring himself for sure. I also believe those involved had a good reason very likely tied closely to the fighting in the lands between."
Eldenring,SerGreeny,"Ask it to draw the final boss of Elden Ring.  

You can make it generate a bunch of things from ER and then play bingo of what AI got right."
Eldenring,Nethermoosen,Effort. Well done.
Eldenring,merayous,Alerta de pretinho colorido
Eldenring,West_Scarcity3911,"&gt;but I don't think it's going to be that huge.

I'm curbing expectations as well. I'm confident about From's approach to level design, in that they don't have to wow me with sheer size, the open connected nature is good enough for me. 

I remember an article after BoTW launched where the devs explained and demonstrated the sort of ""mnemonic"" they employed to design and extrapolate that humongous world and I was surprised at how relatively trivial it was to extrapolate a whole world like that out of what were basically just single-dimension story boards. 

Don't be surprised if ER ends up surprising you at a larger then expected scale."
Eldenring,Toe-Person74,Exactly what I‚Äôve been thinking
Eldenring,fingay-ren,"I reckon the background will just  be solid black, but this looks really cool!"
Eldenring,LesserManatee08,"No worries, I like the cosplay build a lot man!"
Eldenring,Fast_Broccoli4867,tree....fiddy.....
Eldenring,LesserManatee08,"Absolutely, I just can barely wait for Elden Ring to be released. Just the raw amount of content that they say is allegedly in the game is mouth watering...."
Eldenring,DJSourNipple,Yeah that‚Äôs how I feel about it. 95% of alll the things to do are fetch quests or shrines which are just the same 3 physics puzzles over and over again. Sure you can climb stuff and chop down trees but after the first hour it loses all its appeal. To me BoTW is a hard 6/10
Eldenring,Vladimmir,"My boss (around my age and has done the same thing before) knows I‚Äôm taking off for it because I have tons of PTO to burn, not going to play it the whole time but it‚Äôll give me plenty of time to play and and still do other stuff with the time off"
Eldenring,Raine386,"I make a Divine Bastard sword every DS1 play through, just for the Catacombs"
Eldenring,Shartle,Dude this is kinda perfect. Ever notice how the theme in ds1 is basically nonexistent then the ones in 2 and 3 kinda pick up incrementally? This one being so epic would fit that trend.

Eldenring,iiii_Hex,iHops pre-date fantasy castles.
Eldenring,Bivolion13,"I really really love things like this if it exists.

Only thing is that if they do I really hope there are clues rather than having to rely on the community or looking it up.

Even if the clue is a hidden npc that talks about it."
Eldenring,bottlerockett77,"Sounds like an easy achievement. I've never rage quit a soulsborne game. I've had to take a pause after dying to a stressful boss, but that's just setting down the controller and going to get a drink or something."
Eldenring,nogills,where do you get this countdown widget?
Eldenring,bottlerockett77,Even better. I'd assume the thorns cause bleeding/serrated damage?
Eldenring,glimmeria,Likely all the youtubers and streamers who got early access would be the ones to post and stream the ending on launch day lmfao
Eldenring,stanky22222,can it be my turn to post this next week?
Eldenring,PretinhoColorido,"probably wanting some easy views, but it doesn't hurt to join his channel in 3 days &gt;.&gt;"
Eldenring,NinGangsta,Ngl those late versions of i3s actually pack a nice punch when overclocked. You just have to close everything else so the cores don't shit out on you
Eldenring,LorenzoApophis,"Pretty much everyone has been saying this since the trailer came out, who thinks otherwise?"
Eldenring,yukadfsa2,"sorry for the shit quality, getting ps4 screenshots to reddit is a pain"
Eldenring,OriginalUser321,"From what people have said (mainly vatvidya) it's not gonna be like that. It seems more like a dark souls 4, with better movement like sekiro. I beg yall to not hype this game as a combo of all their games, you will be disappointed"
Eldenring,NinGangsta,"Elden - 5 letters

Demon - also 5 letters

5 games to make a pentagram but Demon's Souls is not present

Eldenring,HahaLookyhere,"Unless he actually does post the video, its safe to assume this guy is full of shit man"
Eldenring,Purple-Lamprey,"Yeah, this is the biggest issue for PvP but unfortunately it‚Äôs probably due to the open world nature of the game. Unfortunate but oh well."

Eldenring,RubyRod1,If this isn't true it *needs* to be.
Eldenring,ZenMacros,"This has been my theory since the hollowing era. The Elden Ring and whatever god(s) that shattered it are like an inverse of Gwyn and the First Flame; The First Flame gets weaker over time and eventually goes out, but can be reignited before that happens, so Gwyn did just that to keep it going. The Elden Ring, on the other hand, is more constant. It doesn't diminish or go out on its own, it stays the way it is until someone does something with it, which is what happened when the Greater Will shattered it. Why they did that is anyone's guess. Perhaps they saw/foresaw something horrible happening and the only way to prevent it was to shatter it. This likely had something to do with Queen Marika, or perhaps even the king of the Lands Between (or whoever it is she had children with)."
Eldenring,Boii100,"You're right, about 50% of the shot is just the plateu that you start on. And that area is kinda big by itself"
Eldenring,Fevi117,"My only advice, aside from looking up NPC questlines, is to read player placed messages around NPC's. They often will make vague references to the general vibe of the NPC."

Eldenring,Charleyfrost,Faith/Stealth sounds like an interesting combo
Eldenring,bblubber443,"Probably a dex build, assuming that there are some cool paired weapons to play around with (though given that I'd like to go in blind, I won't really know that on my first playthrough). Also would like to try out twinblades, haven't played DS2 but their moveset in that game looks pretty cool from what I've seen, so I would assume that the same will apply here, plus we'll have some completely new weapon arts to play around with for them!"
Eldenring,xX_D347H_KN19H7_Xx,"You need dark souls prepare to die, demon souls, and demon souls remastered."
Eldenring,Fevi117,"Probably won't take time off, just play the game when I can. I still find the best experience when I take my time and enjoy it at my leisure."
Eldenring,LowRespond7680,lol
Eldenring,InsidiousBiscut,"For a while I thought this was that Valk lady, given her body is literally breaking down in this scene which would explain the prosthetics we see on the valk boss. Not sure what this would imply really, but maybe someone else can piece it together."
Eldenring,AlreadyTaken1594,Lol nice.  Gottem
Eldenring,Fevi117,I love how well papa zak's face fits this image
Eldenring,miuchiweighsaton,"Everyone brings up Majula, Heide's Tower, or Dragon Aerie when talking about the environments of DS2, and Drangleic Castle gets forgotten. I love its design with the indigo bricks and grey trim. It looks unlike any of the other castles in the series (though one seen in the preview of *Elden Ring* has a similar, though less minimalist, design). The first NPC you meet inside is a literal ghost. The enemies are mostly statues animated to life. It feels abandoned, but is not dilapidated and crumbling like the other Dark Souls castles. The rain completes it, giving it an atmosphere the other castles don't touch.

Looking Glass Knight is the best boss in the base game, and for a throwaway gank reskin, Twin Dragonriders actually isn't bad. The dark room with the Ruin Sentinels sucks though, I'll give the detractors that.

(Boleterian Palace is my second pick if anyone cares.)"
Eldenring,icecreamsandwich,They‚Äôve talked in the released interviews about how they wanted Elden Ring to be big but not big for no reason. Seems like they‚Äôre making an effort to make sure it‚Äôs got lots to see and explore wherever you go and doesn‚Äôt feel empty. Pretty exciting
Eldenring,singh853,"You‚Äôre not alone. If you play any of these games blind, you‚Äôre gonna miss quest lines and interactions your first playthrough. Several soulsborne ‚Äúquests‚Äù are pure chance of you being in the right place at the right time, and holding the right item. 

I actually predict Elden Ring will be more user friendly in terms of guiding you along quests, since the map will be the biggest."
Eldenring,Phat_Joe_,Is the AI gpt-3 based? If so where did you find the API for drawings like this?
Eldenring,dynamicflashy,Except for Dark Souls 3 in which the launch trailer was effectively the game.

Eldenring,pastor_jerome,But how am I supposed to know what game I m hyped for now?
Eldenring,dwise317,Their marketing techniques are good enough to have the world talking about elden ring. But not good enough to satisfy the die hands. I think they are doing okay.

Eldenring,Ashen_Shroom,"TW3 also has a lot of features that ER won't have. FROM don't need to create densely populated towns and cities, dynamic roaming NPCs, or dozens of side quests. This means that they can devote their time and resources to things like AI that responds to different levels of visibility, vertical level design, large dungeons etc. None of this stuff is groundbreaking. While it may be true that we don't often see all of these features in one open world game, you have to remember that FROM won't be incorporating a lot of aspects we *do* tend to see in open world games. They're not breaking new ground here, they're just prioritising certain elements over others."

I truly hope that all the doubters (including myself) will eat their words once the game releases and ends up being a massive success. Maybe they have marketing moves planned for the next weeks that will be so convincing that everything just starts to make sense.

Eldenring,DarkSouls_simp,"Terrible idea. Stop with this idea of ""help"". They are doing this with pvp with no invasions for single players to make it less ""annoying"".  It feels like they are trying to make this too much accessible to the point where it can take away from the fun of exploration and challenge. This watchtower idea is terrible and generic. I don't need to find every single dungeon on my First playthrough. Also why are they contradicting themselves? They don't want to explicitly say the game is ""open world"" saying bullshit like open world has many definitions but then they add something like this because ""oh the world is too big and you will need it""."
Eldenring,FlannOff,"I mean all of this comments are wrong, multiplayer in Souls games is even explained in official lore to be part of world and one of it's primary caracteristic, undeads help and fight each others for souls and covenant duty and it's only possible because time converge and cross different realities and timelines, an npc like Solaire that helps your char offline have the same role as a real player that want to be summoned as a phantom, while npc invaders like Kirk are the same as real player invaders.
You have the choice to play offline but that doesn't mean it's the ""correct"" way to play, the game without bloodstains, ghosts, summon signs, comments on the ground and casual invasions feels desolated, the interesting point of this games when you're online is the fact you can SEE on real time other people making your same journey, which is also canon in lore."
Eldenring,Jllemos,"Considering the ‚Äúzoom with this structure‚Äù part, i‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs less ‚Äúmarks all dungeons within range‚Äù and more ‚Äúdungeons you find with your binoculars are marked on the map for you to go to‚Äù, which i‚Äôm fine with."

Eldenring,Dbok2123,"I don't know about this one guys. This is a pretty big mechanic that somehow no one except this Indonesian journalist mentioned. You'd think that if it was in the game, Fromsoft themselves would mention it (they aren't deceitful) or those who watched the 16 minute demo would have mentioned it in their articles. 

It's also important to note this information was received in Japanese, translated to Indonesian, and then once again translated to English. There is *bound* to be some inaccuracy in the relaying of the info, if it is true in any way.

Let's just wait and see before we make judgments on whatever the hell is going on with this game's mechanics."

Eldenring,1stNone,"What I thought was, you would hear something like ""X dungeon lies to the east"" and you would travel east and while traveling, see the area in the distance. Fromsoft handcrafted the world after all, and they have good experience with this. The game can be open world and still have a guided experience.

Now it sounds more like you go looking around for watchtowers in the distance to gain markers on your map. And I hope its not that simple.

Putting all that aside, its an open world game, so the player should feel the desire to explore, you know? If this watchtower works like how it sounds, most players will just be clearing them off the map like a checklist."

Eldenring,stamwisegamgee,Maybe they showed slightly different length videos to the press? That way if one got out they'd be able to track down who they showed it to.
Eldenring,Captain_Beemo_,"Huh? I don‚Äôt think you get it.

Eldenring,skcrita,"I kinda disagree, I love the PvE experience but the real reason I got into dark souls was because of the PvP. Sure, it never has been the ""main"" focus of the souls games but I think if Ds1 and Ds2 didn't have PvP the game would have a smaller following. I mean on YouTube, rather than the handful of popular lore channels, most people are watching and making PvP videos. The first time I ever even saw dark souls was through a DS2 bellkeeper video.

 It also adds a shit ton more replayability to the game, especially on consoles where you don't have things like mods. When it comes down to it , there are only so many ways to beat and play ds3. But in PvP you get a different experience everytime."

Eldenring,mushroomglass,The last thumbnail leak clocked the video at 16:45 and 1.03GB or something like that. Something weird is going on. Both have images we've never seen and they both look pretty hard to fake.
Eldenring,Yozul1,"I think more than any other game I've played I'd say that to decide if you should buy the game you should just look at a bunch of screenshots. The combat is serviceable, but definitely can't carry the game alone. It's really all about the exploration, tone, and aesthetic. If you think it looks like a bunch of samey hallways you will just have a miserable experience. If it's your style though, it is a very rewarding world to explore. I love it, but it is definitely not for everyone."

Eldenring,Yozul1,"Unfortunately immediately after deciding that they want to release more games on PC they went and made upscales of a bunch of their most popular PS4 exclusives a selling point for the PS5.

Eldenring,SnooDonuts5477,"I think this might be poorly translated, I don't think fromsoft would do anything as uninspired as simply adding Ubisoft towers, but at the same time it might function as just another level of entry for new players that other players can just ignore.

Otherwise, this does sound like it might be a bit more involved i.e. not just immedietly revealing the entire area but rather towers you can climb up, us binoculars so scope out from a vantage point, and then you are able to mark objectives from there? I'd like to see the gameplay before making a judgement here"
Eldenring,beatsy_ray,"Sekiro 2 is an inevitability in opinion, but currently they might be working an a new Armored Core, or spiritual successor to that franchise."
Eldenring,crazed_ikarian,"I agree but this is the only person that has ever coded a solution to this. Plus my only other share option would've been a 2hr long live-stream where he tests his netcode patch with other players. 

I'm happy as long as more people get informed about the issue and how easy but important a solution for it is. Even if the video format sucks ass."
Eldenring,loltrollface1488,People don't seem to understand that this is actually closer to the botw than ubisoft because you really need to look out for these dungeons from the tower instead of the automatic map markers
Eldenring,SoufDakotas,I wonder if its gonna be like softs and ds2 same game extra content and bug patches
Eldenring,Nikolai-King-of-Ash,"Generally agree with you on things back, but a few things:

&gt; but I feel like defense punished split damage weapons way way too hard,  
 making many of them downright unusable, like the dancers.

That's actually more a problem with dancers then anything, as each blade attacks with the related damage stat individually, meaning the damage is actually dramatically less then the AR implies.

Several weapons can be infused for comical results, as an example the Dark Drakeblood Greatsword will have over 700 Ar when used with all the trimmings of a 80 dark build, and will absolutely demolish most targets. Similarly, getting three damage types on something like the Dragonslayer's Axe can do very good damage.

Another weapon considered quite good by the community is the Onyx Blade, which paradoxically has a WA that makes it deal fire damage alongside it's dark damage base, and it does amazing numbers. ^(yes I'm aware the flames are black but it's a lie) 

&gt;A good looking (and useful) transformation. All the dragon forms (except  
 for 2s which looked cool) look like anorexic deer. Some badass looking   
transformation that lends itself to a certain build/playstyle would be   
cool to have (and I don't mean glass cannon, because it obliterates all   
of your defensive stats).

[How dare you insult the Ds1 dragon](https://i.imgur.com/G1wa8pv.jpg) I love him

To give the smallest amount of credit to the ds3 form, it has one single good function which is that the Dragon's Body Stone (not the twinkling, but the base) is actually extremely useful in PVP and specifically in invasions, due to it being essentially unblockable and providing you with an easy escape option (and near constant guard breaks\_

Beyond that, it was shit, however I do suspect we are getting some sort of wolfman transformation. The howling fellow in the trailer isn't clipping right with the cliffside, implying it's not a animation intended for that rock, but for general use, so It could well be that we will be joining some sort of lycanthrope covenant, which I would expect would be involved with the other beastman we've seen around. Or not, who fucking knows, I could be talking out of my ass.

Oh, there are reports of the Twinkling Dragon Head Stone being re-used as some sort of item (assumedly related to Goddrick, as the head is described as being the same one he has in the trailer), but I doubt that means anything

&gt;More widespread unique bonuses on armor. Wouldn't it be cool if for   
example wearing the masters attire in ds3 would give you a tiny boost to  
 your dodge iframes? Just talking a small boost to tie into the item   
description it has.

This is actually my favorite feature in Dark Souls 2, and something they should have used more in DS3. Sets coming with specific benefits is actually a good thing overall, as it helps classify themselves for what builds might use them, and create further branching choices in your build customization. Great feature, it would be nice to see more broad-leaning abilities on them. Sets that boost mobility and utility would really do nicely alongside some good customization for other builds."

And some people just want to play through the game together, and they should have that option. Maybe that should also increase the difficulty of the game to balance it out, the way bosses become harder when you summon people.

Jolly cooperation is an important part of the game."

It's a fairly common mistake and if you do that, I believe it won't naturally grow back until next spring. However, you can buy grass starter from the store, or the recipe and craft it yourself.

Plant a few around the farm and let it grow. Make sure animals can't reach the grass early on by fencing it off. Once it has spread enough to be sustainable, you can let them eat it and harvest the extra for hay."

If you are struggling with gold, crops like parsnips that have a quick turnaround can multiply quickly if you reinvest all of your profits buying seeds (up to the point where watering consumes all of the energy you're willing to spare, then crops like potatoes, radishes, and eggplant are good for quick turnarounds, with cauliflower, melons, and pumpkins being best for the long run). Fishing is also a great way to make a quick buck if you are good at the mini game."

StardewValley,GengarSucksBalls,"I wouldn't divorce Abby, let alone divorce her for Shane. Marrying Shane feels like a regression compared to all of his story.

Now, as of how do you get to the witch, you have to complete the community center first. After that, there's a cutscene with the wizard in the railroad area. To progress, you need to have unlocked the sewers."
StardewValley,Alice3464_,"What i did was complete a run-through with Abigail, Then when I got bored, I created a new farmer and got with Shane instead. That way none of the npcs would hate for breaking their hearts. But if you don't feel bad for hurting npcs feeling like I do, you should do what makes you enjoy the game more.

StardewValley,Gregorian7,Seed makers were my best friend for the quest. I basically planted any seeds I found (around 10 to 20) and then used the fruit to make more seed with the seed makers. Kept doing that until I had enough seeds and then just waited for the final groups of harvest and shipped them all. Ended up finishing up with a day or two left over and some extra fruits.  I recommend kinda having a rough game plan to begin with to make sure you have enough time to get enough and using the farm on Ginger Island which has enough space to grow 500+ crops if spaced correctly. In my opinion relying on seed makers is way easier than frantically looking for beans.

Potatoes for extra harvest quick grow time until the 13th of spring use all your money to get strawberries 

Summer get all the blueberries you can untill you have access to either ancient fruit or star fruits  or you can get hops but that‚Äôs hella Grind 

Fall all the cranberries you can untill you can use a seed maker and then use it on all the cranberries you get 2-4 seeds back and after a certain point they start to sell for more then the fruit itself

StardewValley,bennie711,"Usually it means your co-op player has completed the quests to move the bodyguard dude, but unless you did all of them as well you dont get access even though the guy isnt there

StardewValley,johnpeters42,What are her favorite gifts?
StardewValley,johnpeters42,"Glitch: Joja members are allowed to gain money. :)

The glitch with naming yourself [74] still works, afaik, except on Switch. Though if you‚Äôre on PC, you could also just install a mod to give yourself money directly."
StardewValley,Mrs_Hyacinth_Bucket,So adorable!!
StardewValley,iTechsTR,"Yeah then it makes sense that even if I get married to her now and get her to 10 hearts, the 8 heart event will still occur on 1st day of spring. Am I correct?"
StardewValley,Moyasu,It‚Äôs crazy cause I made 2 accounts one is at 55 hours and I have all the scrolls the second is at like 17 hours and I need the red scroll and that one drops at all levels of the mines so mate you got this

StardewValley,AC_NLGirl,"How is Haley as a wife? I‚Äôm currently playing a file where I made my settings difficult and I think everyone hates me lol. In other files I have married Penny, Abigail, Leah and Maru. I didn‚Äôt enjoy Maru and Abigail because they still seemed really childlike even after marriage. I divorced Penny because she didn‚Äôt interact with me after marriage at all. Couldn‚Äôt even talk to her while she was walking the kids to class. Leah is my favorite she‚Äôs amazing and easy to get along with! 

This save file though I‚Äôm determined to marry either Emily or Haley. Which one would you go with? They are sisters so it‚Äôs hella weird lmao but it‚Äôs gonna be one of them!!"
StardewValley,probablyonmobile,They seem to be... Preparing to drop some kind of album?
StardewValley,johnpeters42,"My understanding is that, once you‚Äôre at 8+ hearts with her, then the 8 heart cut scene happens as soon as all its other trigger conditions are met. (idk what happens if you were at 8 but then dropped below. I also think they can occur out of order, e.g. if you get her to 10 and then in spring go to the forest before going to town.)"

StardewValley,marquesasrob,"Is it possible for the random name generator for the child to give you the name Mikasa? My little brother keeps saying it gave it to him randomly, but I know he‚Äôs lying because he named his farmer Eren like the attack on Titan character and there‚Äôs no way it randomly named his kid Mikasa after that. But he just won‚Äôt come clean, so I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a list of all possible random names for the baby somewhere"

StardewValley,Free_Acanthocephala8,Stardew can be strangely punishing at times.
StardewValley,CeruleanTresses,Diverse Stardew Valley (on ModDrop) has the same functionality and is 1.5 compatible. You can choose not to turn on the alternate race versions of the characters and it will work just like SVO. It used to be the same team working on both mods so a lot of the outfits are the same.
StardewValley,mooshu1x2,It's the thought that counts Sebby.
StardewValley,SaberToothGerbil,They are available for a few weeks in the spring around here for $4-$6/pound. I always bring some for my mom on mothers day. Or you can harvest them your self from the woods. I used to have a massive patch in my yard.

StardewValley,goode2shus,"The box to the right of the farmhouse is your 'sell' box.  You put items in there that you want to sell.  To make a chest to store items in, you need 50 pieces of wood.  Then you can craft a chest in your craft menu."

StardewValley,MerleyMonster,"That chest is where you put things in you want to sell, you get money at night for the things you put in Its not a storage chest! So yeah, when you put new things in it, you won't be able to take the previous things out of it. If you need a storage chest, you can make one from 50 wood pieces, its in your crafting menu"

StardewValley,pericataquitaine,"Wild trees drop their seeds in a one-tile radius around themselves. If there is grass on those tiles, the seeds will not drop.

StardewValley,lBluelMoon,"You‚Äôll get random rewards for donating certain types/amounts of items, and donating the ancient seed is kinda required in order to get access to both a crafting recipe and a plantable seed(not the only way to get the seed but one of the very few) you also need to donate a certain amount to the museum to unlock another area of town + NPC/shop"
StardewValley,aranaya,Yum
StardewValley,CricketSage,Thanks! You too!
StardewValley,cherryblossombelmont,"Thank you very much! I'm glad to hear it, I've been working on my art style a little more and I'm glad to hear it seems recognisable enough! CQ was definitely fun to draw, I wanted to try my hand at it after seeing other artists give it a go years back. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
StardewValley,vampyrwu,this looks really good im shocked
StardewValley,CricketSage,Thanks!
StardewValley,Trailblazer723,"Very, very lucky. Plot armoured anime characters would die for that luck."
StardewValley,atravita,"Has the bathroom mod ever worked on this save?

The reason why I'm asking is that you seem to have some tiles that represent the bed. In 1.4, the bed was unmovable and was just part of the room; in 1.5, the bed became a furniture item. You seem to have somehow gotten some of the tiles that made the bed in 1.4.

I'd try uninstalling/reinstalling the game first, but you may have to manually edit out those tiles."
StardewValley,reddeadnate,Kinda sus ngl
StardewValley,Squatting-Turtle,thanks!
StardewValley,Squatting-Turtle,thank you
StardewValley,tommytambor,Ohhh *snap*!!
StardewValley,AtheistBibleScholar,Agree and thanks. I just checked the Google machine and found out the mobile players are up to 1.5 and have the lost and found. Otherwise I would have brought it up.

StardewValley,Squatting-Turtle,"Man Im just not having much luck on tree growing. Owch that hurts, im having an awful time timing me tree growing then.

Thats nice that I can grow mahogany though.  I did just now get one seed so far.

StardewValley,JustAlex1177,"That's so cool! Someone has to make a Pelican Town neighborhood. 

I think in the Sims 3 it would be possible with the CAW tool. You could even make a more desert area for Sandy's Oasis, and a tomb for the Skull Cavern if you have World Adventures. 

Both the cavern and the mine can have mummy sarcophagi for mobs to fight, and gem/metal spawners for the ores and gems. Retexturing chests to look like crates is not hard either.

Making an island would be possible too, and even better if you have Island Paradise EP to get boats and stuff to get there faster. Maan... it would be amazing. I can see Maru working on her inventing skills, Penny with her teaching career... Sam having the Rockstar aspiration...

And I think that if I had a Mayor Lewis copy die from that gold curse would work to have a gold statue of himself. And hide it in his backyard."
StardewValley,HelloMotherCluckers,This is the way
StardewValley,SlimyFarmer,yes! i just really want there to be some reason for that! and this would be a possible reason.
StardewValley,atravita,So....I don't actually understand why SMAPI is asking for manifest.json in the terminal directories - I'd expect manifest.json to be located in Mods/Stardew Valley Expanded/\[CP\] Stardew Valley Expanded . Can you confirm that there's a file called manifest.json there?
StardewValley,SlimyFarmer,right? it's definitely a theory that would plausibly explain the secrecy &amp; some of the similaries between them.
StardewValley,GengarSucksBalls,You can still get back your items from uncompleted quests. Just go the lost and found box in Lewis' house.

StardewValley,Notthatgreatdane,"There's a worthwhile reward after a number of donations. You'll know when it happens, there's a cutscene."

StardewValley,Trailblazer723,"If you have upgraded your axe a few tiers (forgot which tier), you can chop a fallen log at  the Cindersap Forest, on the path all the way left of Marnie's ranch.

StardewValley,atravita,That...seems like the mod Immersive Spouses to me?
StardewValley,superonyxfire,interesting! So it's just amusing when we get them from lower levels instead of during grinding skull cavern?
StardewValley,megthegreatone,"Ok I have never seen my ducks do this - they have a big area to wander but they can access the pond and go to it often, they're always super happy and have full hearts with me, I don't know what more I can do üò≠"
StardewValley,oOHITMANOo,HYYPEEEE!!!!
StardewValley,Thorn344,"This is obviously spoilers so read at your own risk. There are several ways. One way is to rank up the woodcutting skill, as one of the skill trees allows you to unlock the ability to get hardwood from regular trees. Another way is to explore the map outside the farm. Once you upgrade to a better ace, there is a large log that blocks the entrance to a hidden forest area. Inside are 5 or so stumps that resplendent every day that drop hardwood."

StardewValley,PKMNwater,"I know you put marks around ""for sure"" to point out that you're talking rudimentary multiplication of odds and understand that statistics are statistics, but I'll add for emphasis.

The odds don't change based on a failed (or passed) roll, so the .09% will always be .09%, regardless of how many iterations pass. It can be 10000 years before you get one, and that'd be independently be as likely as getting one the first day."

StardewValley,hockiw,"We often see requests for help in designing an attractive farm or what to put in an empty space. But tastes and goals differ so much from player to player that it‚Äôs hard to offer advice that will be useful or appeal to YOU.

The all-time best advice I *can* offer is to hang around these subs, look closely at the posted images of farms, and borrow the bits that you like or appeal to you. I keep a scrapbook of farm screenshot details I like and why I like them. (Is it the lighting? The Bee House layout? The outdoor picnic area? The clever way of hiding a silo?)

Plan the layout of your farm outside of the game with this tool https://stardew.info/planner/

Reorganizing your farm layout in Winter is a good idea. It‚Äôs so much easier without all the grass and tree leaves and debris.

(And a note about grass: Planting grass starter in the last few days of winter will result in a huge explosion of grass on Spring 1.)"

StardewValley,ModernAustralopith,"Variety is the spice of life. And of contests.

You get points for each category of item you include, up to six different categories. You then get points based on the value of the items and their star quality.

There are guides online to what kinds of items to use. There's also a tool called the [Stardew Fair Helper](https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-fair-helper/) where you can upload your save file, and it'll look at all of the items you have (in your inventory or in chests) and tell you which ones to use to get the highest score."

StardewValley,a-rag-man,Oh..in that case.. thanks! :D

StardewValley,Butterscotch_T,"Truffles are a type of mushroom that you can get thanks to pigs. They have a high sell price so they give a lot of points for the display. I think it's more fun to try to make a varied, colourful display though."
StardewValley,cadbojack,"So glad for you! Fishing was the first aspect of the game I decided to dive into, that sensation of getting a legendary fish for the first time is amazing. Congratulations =)"
StardewValley,MySucculentDied,"Always have 9 items, it gives the most points, with 1-4 (?) items being worth negative points.

There‚Äôs 5 different categories I believe:

- forage
- minerals
- farming
- artisan
- animal products

I haven‚Äôt checked the wiki, so someone correct me if I missed any.

Each unique category in your display gives you more points. High quality and rarer items give you more points. So an iridium goat milk is slightly better than an iridium large egg. 

Diamonds are the most valuable mineral, worth the most points, so just have one diamond, no other minerals (unless you can‚Äôt fill the other slots with unique items). If you don‚Äôt have casks, the most expensive base wines will give you high scoring points compared to, say, salmon berry wine. Pale ale, (high quality) goat cheese, truffle oil and (high quality) mayo are some other good options. 

Fishing‚Ä¶ just have high quality expensive fish.

Just have as many high quality or rare unique items as possible."
StardewValley,hockiw,"@Boring was joking. A variety of crops, minerals, and artisan products is the key ‚Äî the highest quality you have."
StardewValley,tifftaffy,"One each of high quality of fish, forage, crop ie pumpkin and melon, gem, cooked item, animal product, artisan product, and 1 more to fill last spot"
StardewValley,Stargirl2151,Ahhhh probably. There‚Äôs definitely one type of fish that keeps getting away and that‚Äôs probably it. Does it usually jump up and then down immediately? (Ironically I have caught a Lingcod in these fishing trips haha)

StardewValley,illusion17,"I was mostly talking about how George reacts when you choose that option. He completely forgets about what she does and tries to tell her that what she did wasn't wrong and her kind intentions were all that mattered. I  would  have  much  rather  seen George explain to her that though he's thankful of her attempts to help, that her actions were very rude in reality. At least in my opinion, pushing someone in a wheelchair without asking is akin to picking someone up and moving them without asking. So, I didn't really like how the game sort of ignores what she did in favor of focusing on  her intentions."

StardewValley,AnyRefrigerator5315,I got one last night fishing too!
StardewValley,MedicalAnomaly19,Fruit trees will grow year round when you plant them but they won‚Äôt produce fruit year round. That‚Äôs why the greenhouse is beneficial.
StardewValley,Ok_Blueberry_5305,"Yeah, and wanted to get a stockpile going so i wouldn't have to worry about it and could afford buildings. Forgot that the last time I did that it was multiple harvests on a farm with a lot more trees and a *much* bigger area for trees to grow, as I had left pretty much the entire left side of a standard farm completely untouched until halfway through the first winter aside from clearing rubble."

StardewValley,Fifth-Crusader,An ancient relic from a bygone era.
StardewValley,Tiny-Charge9742,"The other comment summed it up best, but the only thing that I would add is to use warp totems. If you have any farm warp totems saved up or if you can make some, they would be really helpful to use, so you can stay on the island longer without having to run all the way home. Once you unlock more things on the island, you won't really have to worry about that much anymore. Until then, farm warp totems will be your best friend!"

StardewValley,Doge_Enthusiast777,Dogs since they run around and I have 2 irl. If there was a bird option I'd get it instead since I used to have the coolest parakeet growing up.
StardewValley,zoblelee,"Yes they will start to respawn even if you‚Äôve cleared the area! I‚Äôd definitely recommend saving any tree seeds you find instead of crafting them into field snacks so you can replant them in areas that don‚Äôt get in your way. You can start putting a bunch of tappers on them so you can get maple syrup, oak resin, and pine resin :) it will come in handy! Then you can chop down any trees you don‚Äôt have tappers on for wood. You can also go chop down trees in the forest area for wood &amp; save some on your farm for tappers"

This part of the mod is already finished! Currently I'm adding sprites to replace the artisan goods and some of the 'springobject' items. Will add more over time.

If interested you find the mod on Nexus: [https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9414?tab=description](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9414?tab=description)

Please note that my sprites are without outlines and do not fit the devs artstyle, but I plan on doing enough sprites so that it will fit in the future. Hope you don't mind so far.

Enjoy the mod and let me know if somethings doesn't work right."
StardewValley,bv310,Most recently was doing an entire year 1 on a Beach farm and not realizing that there's a little dirt patch you can put sprinklers on.

StardewValley,Coruscafire9,"Fruit tree saplings can only be planted on the farm, but you can plant the other tree seeds (oak, maple, pine etc) on other maps. You may need to pickaxe the hoed spot back first though."
StardewValley,jeffwolfe,"Almost always choose cats, but the one time I went the Joja route, I got a dog."
StardewValley,GrandNanns,"Cats, but mostly because the dogs run away when I'm trying to pet them üôÅ"
StardewValley,CowlickedAndBroke,When Elliot was the first person I encountered in the game and so I gave him some weeds and he said he hates me. From that day forward I went out of my way to make Elliots life a living hell.
StardewValley,Alluminus,"Made it well into the 40s in the skull cavern (furthest I've ever made it), had plenty of time left in the day, could've easily made it to level 100... except for the fact that I warped myself back to my farm at 7:00pm. I have not been back since"
StardewValley,ashleevee,"I did the Wizards ink quest, got into his tower from the witch‚Äôs hut to give it to him, but then he wouldn‚Äôt let me go back through there to get back to my horse. I was livid."
StardewValley,elijaaaaah,"They're all good, but I generally go for gray cat or pointy-eared dog. I tend towards the dog because even though in SDV it's perfectly safe I feel weird letting even a pretend cat roam outdoors, lol."
StardewValley,EmptyPomegranete,I found a prismatic shard and went down a staircase before it could enter my inventory
StardewValley,minidanjer,"""Bring something good."" I brought ice cream.

The only valid item I had in my inventory was a random Sweet Pea that I picked up along the way. They were not enthused."
StardewValley,PearlDustAndLights,TIL: Clint is a toddler. ‚ÄúHere is ore.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo! New ore!‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ *drops ore* look new ore we just found.
StardewValley,MisterFreddo,Yes but he was planning to launch it with multiplayer that's why it took so long. He ended up releasing it with single player and released the multiplayer a couple years after.
StardewValley,MamaSquash8013,"This happened to me too!!! I swear I didn't sell it or accidentally make mayo! I was holding onto it because my incubator was occupied, and it disappeared!"
StardewValley,Recllusive,Lol I legit stared at this picture for a good 30 seconds wondering how you got that duvet pattern for your bed...
StardewValley,LuckyReception6701,"That's true but the villagers are also kinda dense. What a coincidence Pierre started growing his own crops just as soon as a farmer stablished his farm on the town! And he also sells his produce to him! 
Truly remarkable coincidence!"
StardewValley,Literary_Squagon,Well that‚Äôs‚Ä¶blursed

StardewValley,SnooDrawings1480,Or dump the slime
StardewValley,pta391,"We think alike, I ate the berry. Just not sure if it matters where I put the auto petter on the farm?"
StardewValley,music_sun2025,"i do too! plus, the way cat‚Äôs stretch out and sleep outside is adorable üíú"
StardewValley,HighlanderOneTrick,"Off the top of your head, do you know if high value crops get prio on keg/jar over hops? Or if you keg hops jar the others? etc"
StardewValley,ashleevee,Okay but not being able to marry Willy is another of the many crimes of Stardew valley
StardewValley,SkyScamall,"Me trying to talk to Sebastian at the start of every game. Please let me in, sir. I need to meet all the villagers!"
StardewValley,Chromgrats,This hurts to look at
StardewValley,hollyviolet96,"Shane‚Äôs heart events are too much for me. Just, oof."
StardewValley,HomeworkNotAssigned,"Oh, I never really realized that, the fact that he seemed so rude at first made me think he was cocky.My farmer was a woman so probally that changed the thing, thanks for the information."
StardewValley,LuckyReception6701,"Fun fact, Egyptians began adoring cats exactly because of that reason, since they hunt down vermin that destroys crops, they were seen as divine guardians, sent by the gods to safeguard the harvest, and thus, prevent famine. The patron God of Cats was Bast.

Sorry for the impromptu history lesson is just that what you said remained of that.

Also that was a long lived cat, sorry for your loss"
StardewValley,Jenniferinfl,"Using 100 staircases on a good luck day in the mine and only getting one treasure chest and it just had elixir. 

Then I died and lost my iridium sword, my 30+ stack of coffee and my 50+ stack of cheese. Then I hadn't sold anything so it just saved."
StardewValley,ashleevee,"I had a save where I got one very very early from the mines, I think from killing a monster. I go through the mines as fast as I possibly can to get the minecarts unlocked, so I would be surprised if it was sometime in the first week or two of spring. My current save though is on Spring year 2 and I‚Äôve already found 6-7! Some saves are just lucky!"
StardewValley,PearlDustAndLights,SAAAAAAME!!! I can‚Äôt remember what I brought though!
StardewValley,SkyScamall,It took me years to realise you had to ask people twice before they'd dance with you. I had hearts with everyone by the second flower dance but didn't get to dance with anyone until at least year five.
StardewValley,Louisfroor,Why does Lewis watch you?
StardewValley,kota99,I've had the Qi beans quest become available on the last Monday of the season and according to people in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/kjpfn3/15_spoilers_can_we_talk_about_that_challenge/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/mp2ijm/i_guess_i_misunderstood_takes_4_days_to_mature/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I'm not the only one. It's possible it spawned that late due to a bug.
StardewValley,johnpeters42,"Common rules of thumb:

Process normal quality, sell silver, keep gold for gifts (if it's someone's loved gift).

Grow enough high price crops to keep your kegs/jars busy, maybe a little extra, then most of the rest can be stuff like berries where individual price is low but volume is high. Those just get sold as is. Throw in extra for gifts, cooking, flower honey, polyculture achievement, or just because you feel like it.

You can sit down with the wiki and work out gold per day from any given crop, just for the keg/jar leg, assuming that you grow a bunch and then process it over time (including winter). Then adjust to taste based on how much time you want to spend on fast cycling stuff like coffee beans or hops.

At the same time, you can set up a tapped tree farm to build more kegs/jars faster."
StardewValley,SkyScamall,That sounds exhausting. I think it's interesting how we all play the game differently. I'm glad it worked for you but please keep it away from me
StardewValley,TeamXII,That spice berry is easily replaceable
StardewValley,Alarmed-Stage-7066,I was so sad!
StardewValley,LuckyReception6701,I choose dogs because I have a dog but I like both
StardewValley,Ooo-im-outta-here,"Apparently, if you take those ores and ‚Äúdrop‚Äù them and then pick them back up again, they‚Äôll count toward that quest."
StardewValley,Poisyn_ivyy,14 years in game!! Sorry for any confusion ‚ù§Ô∏è
StardewValley,LauraMaeflower,"Cats! I own a cat and he‚Äôs the best cat, his name is Pippin."
StardewValley,Fehinaction,You monster!!! :P
StardewValley,attitude_zero,I have around 200 Hours in the game and have yet to find a single one.
StardewValley,Poisyn_ivyy,"It was a crafting recipe! I had all of them so it was driving me insane, not knowing which one I haven‚Äôt made, feeling crazy I just made every single thing and it was the seed maker ü•≤ all 14 years and I NEVER made a seed maker üòÇüòÇ"
StardewValley,PlumsweetSoda,I don't see a problem.
StardewValley,joeshmo101,"Just make sure to add the squid ink, or else you just get salad dressing"
StardewValley,JynxyKash,"Just gotta get to know the guy. He‚Äôs a bit shallow at first but he‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as Haley and Shane. He was honestly never that rude except maybe a couple times when he talks about sports. Once you make it past his 2 heart event he‚Äôs super sweet to chat with, just gotta chip through the ice. Though this is exclusively playing as male characters, it‚Äôs very possible he treats females a bit differently."
StardewValley,kathvrt,Gotta choose the pointy-eared dog cause he looks just like my Australian Cattle Dog
StardewValley,sygnisif,"I know, you‚Äôre not spoiling anything don‚Äôt worry ^^ It‚Äôs hard to describe, and I could go that route, but just for now I enjoy the alone time on my farms with my cats :p"
StardewValley,Nexus_Neo,"she still has a mom though

&amp;#x200B;

and whatever other family lives in her place

&amp;#x200B;

also i hate that guy from jojo somehow just as much as pierre"
StardewValley,AdorableBirdies,You're literally so talented. This is going into my mod list right away and never going away! Thanks for your beautiful art!
StardewValley,LillySatou177013,I don't see the problem???
StardewValley,BigBlackGothBitch,Good for you? Maybe that‚Äôs why you‚Äôve been so tone deaf in this argument in the first place.
StardewValley,meinheinz,This is just vibes I get but I feel like SD is a more cat person type of game.
StardewValley,Dax9000,Are you sure you are not mixing up Alex and Shane?
StardewValley,Reguluscalendula,Oof. I totally get the pain. I had Robin destroy a auto-grabber in my coop three days after I bought because I put it where she stands when she's doing coop upgrades.
StardewValley,TJL-91,Oh god i just know thats gonna happen to me haha
StardewValley,ashleevee,"Yep same! I‚Äôve made it farther on my Switch save, even though my friend said that switch is harder. I‚Äôm really desperate to play the 1.5 update but honestly by the time I get to any of the new content the update will probably be out on mobile lol"
StardewValley,marktheshark124,having the game for 4 years on switch and finding out you only need to to hold Y down when fishing to move the meter I thought you had to tap it
StardewValley,Chromgrats,I know for sure it was Shane. I even made a comment about it on another Reddit post. Maybe I just had a glitched file?
StardewValley,BrunesOnReddit,I've got a whole slew of them. Still hate Pierre. Lmfao
StardewValley,StumbleKitty,"Fall year 1 on my first multiplayer game didn't have a single rainy day. All we needed to complete the community center was the walleye. 
We tried to make the rain totem, but none of us were high level enough in foraging to get the recipe for it. I hit level 9 on the last day of winter. We didn't have any truffle oil. Had to wait an entire in-game year for that fish. ü•≤üíî"

StardewValley,Cablesixback,Dog. But I need a trampoline for him. My Gemma loves the trampoline and I think it would be amusing to watch in game too
StardewValley,AmazingPossible1705,I found like 5 rain totems in skull cavern if you wanted to look there
StardewValley,ashleevee,Ooh yeah that sounds great!! I love fighting monsters but I think it‚Äôs just too hard on pc so that would totally work for me. Thank you!

StardewValley,foxscribbles,"To be fair, NOBODY‚Äôs house contains a shower. Only the spa has them."
StardewValley,thatscifiwriterguy,"Not really. Between CA moving on to a new game to develop and 1.5 basically addressing the ""no late game content"" problem, Stardew - at least in an official capacity - seems pretty much finished off. Of course, modders will probably be working on Stardew for ages yet, so more content may be available that way, but I think the good Mr. Barone has put the finishing touches on the game at this point."
StardewValley,wingedsco,"I did this recently myself. The biggest tip I can give to those in the audience is that the boss levels suck ass, so you need to get good at using the slippy parts of level 2 to complete the level in under 60 seconds to completely skip the boss level. This gives you more consistent chances to practice the levels that come after. The ideal level pick after the ghost ship is the lava zone because mushroom is bullshit. The last level is exhausting. But you just need to have enough lives to power through"

StardewValley,thatscifiwriterguy,"Don't worry; everybody has their fields where they excel and fields where they could use a hand. :)

A .zip file is a way to store a bunch of files together in a more compact form, making them easier to download and move around. It's like a folder on your hard drive, except rather than just being a folder, it's squashed down through some fancy coding to make it take up less space. It also takes a bunch of files and turns them into one convenient bundle so you don't have to download ten loose files, just one zip.

So, as far as modding goes. :)

First off, you're going to need the framework most mods rely on to run. It's called SMAPI. Now, installing it is a little tricky, so there's step-by-step instructions on the wiki, here:[https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Installing\_SMAPI\_on\_Windows](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Installing_SMAPI_on_Windows)

Option A is going to be the easiest, and there's even a helpful video to walk you through the install. Don't worry; this is the hard part. It's all downhill from here. :)

Once you have SMAPI installed, you're going to want to add some mods! Now, most mods use SMAPI, but some use another mod enabler called Content Patcher. Broadly speaking, SMAPI handles mods that make changes to how the game behaves and works, while Content Patcher deals with mods that change how the game looks. (SMAPI enables mods to modify the code, CP allows them to change the artwork.) If you're getting your mods from Nexus - a wise move, by the way - then you can look in each mod's Requirements pull-down to see what it needs to run. If you come across a mod that needs Content Patcher, we can address how to install that, too.

Installing mods is actually pretty easy, so don't worry. First, you'll need to download the mod(s) you want. This will download and save a compressed file, usually a .zip but occasionally another format like .rar. Windows can read .zip files without help, but .rar files will need a third-party program to unpack. (Let us know if you run into that situation.)

When you open a .zip folder, you'll see what's inside. Generally, you'll see a folder with the mod's name on it. That's your mod! Now you just need to put it where SMAPI can find it.

If you right-click on Stardew Valley in Steam, you can choose Manage from the pop-up menu, then click on Browse Local Files. That's the easy way to find Stardew's install directory. A window will pop up with all of the stuff that is Stardew Valley on your PC. You'll see a bunch of files and a few folders. Assuming SMAPI installed correctly, one of those folders will be called Mods. Open that up.

Go back to the zip file you opened up. Drag the folder that was inside (the one with the mod name) into that Mods folder we just found. You've just installed your mod! When SMAPI launches Stardew, it'll look in that Mods folder and try to load any mod content it finds. If there's a problem, the SMAPI screen will tell you with some red text. You can take a screenshot of any errors you run into and post them; people will help. :)

If you still need any help or something here wasn't clear, don't hesitate to ask. And don't feel bad, please. This stuff isn't easy by nature, but you'll get the hang of it. :)"

EDIT: I don't understand why I've been downvoted just for stating how I want to play the game I paid my own money for. I'm an adult and can make my own choices on how I prefer to enjoy the media I consume, people. Is this one of those subreddits where we have to think, act, and speak in line with everyone else to be accepted? Because I'd heard the community was much more supportive than this. I hope that's actually true, I was excited to start when I had a chance. This has soured me a little, though."

StardewValley,JaLychee,"Using item codes, are you, OP ü§®"
StardewValley,mstcartman,"My bet is they have a cabin on the farm so it becomes a multiplayer map, then you can build another stable. Gonna have to play with this myself to confirm, but there isn't an option to build a second stable on my strictly single player save."
StardewValley,ursiwitch,Everyone plays differently. Not everyone plays aggressively.
StardewValley,googleberry174,"Sometimes, mostly noticed when im mining, a tile like this will just randomly appear in my inventory and i find it missing from the area on my farm. I wonder if this is similar or just weeds eating it up."
StardewValley,JaLychee,"What the actual hell, I would be so mad. You invested so much time into that (6 years in game is a helluva lot of time), I'm really sorry that happened to you OP. Absolutely take a break from it if you need it, but I hope this doesn't tarnish your feelings of the game. Wishing you all the best, OP ‚ù§"
StardewValley,noodhoog,"I've never tried using the console commands, but I just started playing with mods, and when I launch stardew now there's a SMAPI command window which opens along side it. I'd assume you can enter any commands into that"
StardewValley,saltimmortalsea,I‚Äôm on it!
StardewValley,randomusername1995,He‚Äôs the one robbing us when we pass out after 2
StardewValley,RandomBudget,You can craft them if Caroline gave you the recipe.
StardewValley,Koeienvanger,I always have about twice as much hay as needed for the winter. I absolutely refuse to let Marnie take full advantage of starving animals by charging that much for a single piece of dried grass.
StardewValley,maleahmnm,omg yes!!! upgradessssss
StardewValley,saltimmortalsea,See how I have a golden chicken? You can have a Skull Cavern serpent!
StardewValley,maleahmnm,i‚Äôm not sure what that is? :3
StardewValley,gallowsserket,Seems a little far fetch'd
StardewValley,ThatsDopeHomie,Stardropme
StardewValley,saltimmortalsea,You can get a flying serpent flair for that! Would you like it?
StardewValley,EquipmentSea9298,Have fun ü§©
StardewValley,koitmiloiti,You ever wonder if there's some things you can't get but know about in SDV that will be available to get in Haunted Chocolatier? Like this type of mushroom for example?
StardewValley,Lzinger,Yup really gotta move that stable over a bit the roof will line up with the house
StardewValley,Adm_Kunkka,"Like imagine how the villagers feel seeing the farmer with fking 24 solid iridium sprinklers just lying outside on his farm, and single one of them would've been enough to make Linus or Pam rich af"
StardewValley,maleahmnm,YAY FOR US
StardewValley,SantiSun,Nice
StardewValley,JaLychee,"It's notoriously difficult to get. What a lot of people do is they'll go there, dig them up, and if it's not the spine they'll restart the day and try again the next day. Keeping the farm clear of crops and debris is also key, I never start a huge farm until I've got both spines."
StardewValley,Kevinpooptail,Hey I made it to level 100 today as well!
StardewValley,HuntressEclipse,I‚Äôm not sure it might tho
StardewValley,Koeienvanger,"Does that make them disappear? Because I'm not above calling for an exorcist at this point, if that was an option.

I'd hoped that divorcing Haley would get rid them since she was the one who wanted them, but no such luck."
StardewValley,[deleted],[removed]
StardewValley,Adm_Kunkka,To flex of course
StardewValley,Gladion20,Oh I thought you fished them up somehow. Did you get them back to back?
StardewValley,JaLychee,"I actually kinda want to see that, I've always just gone the perfect rating route, but I don't think it affects friendship so I might do that next run"
StardewValley,BloodyBeaks,Worth noting that you can't get giant crops &lt;!&gt;in the greenhouse or on the island.&lt;/!&gt;
StardewValley,echothebunny,"It‚Äôs not meant to be a competition. Why do you care what other people are doing in their single player farming game? What imaginary benchmark can you even use to compare and why does it matter? 

You‚Äôre supposed to have fun. If your fun comes from being ‚Äòbetter‚Äô than other people, this is not the right game for you."
StardewValley,Ascension_138,Very helpful! Thank you stranger!
StardewValley,Hellofreeze,Op I hope you have a good day :)
StardewValley,hahahafuckme,Yep sounds good
StardewValley,chig_bungas,Mind if we play tomorrow? It's almost 1 here
StardewValley,Aaarrf,"I serial dated everyone before getting married to Abigail, she gets upset when I give Haley anything but never mentions if I give Emily or anyone else anything. Do they all have like a specific character they are jealous of?"
StardewValley,prompted_animal,"The content your gonna see online is the big flex players who are super hard core
I'm on year 3 currently haven't finished the community center no spouse. Nothing"
StardewValley,Sonya1st,Best thing ever! Means you can call your horse from everywhere! No more wandering far away from your horse and having to walk back or losing your horse altogether lol
StardewValley,Worth_Session_2528,Don‚Äôt give up! It took me 8 years to play through my first play through. If you‚Äôre having fun keep going at your own pace!
StardewValley,fuck_off_ireland,Ugh I'm on ginger island but I don't have all the walnuts and I haven't finished the dungeon... It's my next obstacle to tackle thanks for the info!
StardewValley,Icy_Air7727,how do you get that stone and wood walkways for your farm?
StardewValley,abbeighleigh,the randomized name i got my chicken is Chickard. i thought that name choice was glorious
StardewValley,MusicZombie,"There are better ways to do this, but once I hit the bottom I started farming floor 115 for lava and omni geodes to try and get lucky with breaking them and looking for iridium ore. On my not so lucky days I would break open the geodes that I found and sell whatever extra gems and artifacts that I found, and I also ended up with a lot of gold ore and would usually sell the extra. Again, there are probably better ways of doing it, but this worked pretty well for doing a Mining specific run."
StardewValley,HuntressEclipse,Can‚Äôt u just remove their beds if your on 1.5?
StardewValley,MusicZombie,"There ar ebetter ways to do this, but once I hit the bottom I started farming floor 115 for lava and omni geodes to try and get lucky with breaking them and looking for iridium ore.

StardewValley,slipshod_alibi,"This post proves to me that she doesn't change enough for me to think her attitude is worth it

It's a good thing there's like 7 other options lol"
StardewValley,Koeienvanger,"I can't wait to get a prismatic shard. I tried blocking them in their room, but they have no issue getting out to position themselves by my bed again before I wake up. 

Getting back in at night is somehow impossible though and results in them often standing in the middle of my bedroom. 

For now I've contented myself by stripping their walls and floor bare, and putting that awful gold statue of Lewis between their beds."
StardewValley,Icy_Air7727,i heard somewhere (maybe a facebook stardew group comment?) that jas vincent and penny plant them. not sure how true that is but thought it was cute
StardewValley,Lanky_Ad1994,Nice.
StardewValley,Lonelymasks,Thank you. I'll downgrade and see if it works again.
StardewValley,hahahafuckme,"It‚Äôs all good haha, I‚Äôll be on in 10!"
StardewValley,KaleidoscopeNo4431,Meh I feel like that's how a tent sounds when you're walking on wet ground
StardewValley,dontraenonmyparade,I swear Harvey has literally never mentioned our kids once except for the day after they were born lol. It‚Äôs been several game years.
StardewValley,firecream,Said this to myself. Now I have an extra cow.
StardewValley,International-Cat123,"But when your spouse feeds them, it doesn‚Äôt use any of your stored hay."
StardewValley,chig_bungas,Sorry! I didnt see ur reply until now lol
StardewValley,klubbagaming,What did you find out was your best strategy for getting $ in the mine? I just hit the bottom of the mine &amp; now need $ to unlock the bus
StardewValley,onefinnwolfpack,"It wasn't him, it was me :(

This is a modded save I have and I found out there was a new marriage candidate. I have already married all of the canon SDV candidates so I wanted to experience something new."
StardewValley,crvna87,"I got really excited cause I figured out what hat the mouse didn't have, and found one to give him. But, you can't give him gifts. I just wanted to share my hat love!"
StardewValley,Axe-puff,"I don‚Äôt know how far in the game you are, but‚Ä¶

You can get them from &gt;!mr Qi!&lt; on &gt;!ginger island!&lt; in exchange for &gt;!Qi gems, which you get by completing special quests!&lt;. And through other post-community centre means. They increase the radius of the sprinkler by 1 all round."
StardewValley,ardvarkeating10001,Not if you‚Äôre Haley no
StardewValley,HuntressEclipse,They are a bit creepy tbh
StardewValley,profsoupsalad,"You know, I really wanted to like My Time at Portia, but the art design really irked me for whatever reason. I recognize that it's a really well-made game, and I get why people love it, and I understand that my reason for not liking it is really superficial and stupid. But there it is."
StardewValley,abbeighleigh,"yup it‚Äôs found in the artifact worm spots! when you find you first one, don‚Äôt sell or donate it. put it in the incubator in the coop and it will hatch into a dinosaur that will produce more eggs every few days. then you can donate to the museum and start making dino mayonnaise! i accidentally donated my first egg and had to find another :p"
StardewValley,noodhoog,"I had the quest to give Gus a lobster. I lucked out and got one from the travelling wagon, so went to the Stardrop to deliver it to him

As I went to give it to him, Emily was standing right behind, and I ended up gifting it to her. She doesn't even like lobster.

At the time I didn't think it was a big deal, so I didn't restart the day, and just went to bed. Then I realized how rare lobster are, and it took me ages to catch another one with lobster pots"
StardewValley,tati_drago,Thank you! Will try it with my single play)
StardewValley,Koeienvanger,"Why? I'd rather have the pretty blonde who turns out to be rather sweet, and more importantly *doesn't fucking stare at me while I sleep*, than those creepy little goblins who unexpectedly zoom around the house like startled cats."
StardewValley,Happy_Yogurtcloset_2,Sorcery!
StardewValley,Partywolf85,"no problem! i guess since gravel is a path as opposed to a floor, it won't degrade or break"
StardewValley,alreadytaken619,"Incest. AKA ""pumpin kin"""
StardewValley,fuck_off_ireland,&gt;!pressure nozzles???!&lt;
StardewValley,BluP3nDragon,"As the unofficial official credentials giver ""validator of validation"" I validate your credentials to validate this validation"
StardewValley,idlehum,Nice
StardewValley,Appy127,Thanks
StardewValley,profsoupsalad,"I haven't heard of this game! It looks really interesting. Unfortunately not available for Mac, but that's more of a *me* problem."
StardewValley,firecream,"Yep, that's how I got both of them, had no idea they were rare"
StardewValley,tigerllama,"A Lightning Rod only stops a single strike.  Also note that only the first strike is guaranteed to be intercepted; the chance goes down as more rods get charged.  General consensus is about 20 Lightning Rods.  There's still about a 3% for Lightning to hit something across 6 strikes, but you're not getting much better odds with more.  You'll need 5 more to reduce it to 2%."
StardewValley,mester3249mester3249,"just imagine the first time you got the 10,000,000 G for the clock"
StardewValley,Axe-puff,Looks like they‚Äôve had &gt;!pressure nozzles!&lt; added to them

StardewValley,trashman_12,This is so cute! How did you make that shirt?
StardewValley,XLhannah,Also stan Harvey
StardewValley,CloudCharmer,A [fairy ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_ring) :)
StardewValley,Astronius-Maximus,Is there a reason the booklet version is laid out so weirdly in the document? It seems to be randomly sorted.
StardewValley,BigFluffyFurMan,make sure to buy the joja membership! its very important to progress in the story!
StardewValley,SertainlyKrazy,I genuinely thought that was Krobus' garden. I feel stupid now
StardewValley,International-Cat123,It‚Äôs my understanding that giving any bachelor/bachelorette of your spouse‚Äôs gender ANY gift will result in loss of love.
StardewValley,nemec,"Ah, the parking lot approach."
StardewValley,Gladion20,It‚Äôs more fun when you get one from the garbage
StardewValley,Giang0309,Full of sunflowers to give haley everyday
StardewValley,ashkalaylay,Iridium sprinklers are the 24 surrounding tiles so a 5x5 square.
StardewValley,[deleted],[removed]
StardewValley,Phillyboishowdown,What kind?
StardewValley,QuietCity333,i want a side quest where you can fix up his little shack like with buying pam and penny a house
StardewValley,Burrito_fucker_69,"Imagine a miniature hat store in the little spouse area next to the farmhouse, or a community upgrade to rebuild the abandoned house. That would be cool!"
StardewValley,SilvaIIy,Nice
StardewValley,abbeighleigh,just went to robins shop with the materials
StardewValley,Render_unto_Caesar_,Yea that's weird
StardewValley,Odekel,Farmer muscles
StardewValley,berrylikeova,Me too! Her functioning alcoholism is impressive.
StardewValley,SpydersWeb227,It gets wiped clean every Monday I believe. :)
StardewValley,smallanimalparty,"I just wanted to take time to shill a game made by some ex-devs of the Fable series called Kynseed. It's still in early access but the idea is that you grow up and do a lot of Stardew type stuff in a fantasy setting, and when you have kids you eventually grow old and pass away and then your kids replace you as the player character! Such a neat idea that makes the having children mechanic actually worthwhile. Even in early access so far the game is very promising and I'm really excited for it's full release. It's charming, pretty to look at, and has a ton of quirky humor the Fable games are known for."
StardewValley,Z_odyssey,Ah okay. Couldn't find that. Thank you!
StardewValley,JJsNoodles,"I'm about a month late, but this is really nice!! I'm also on mobile, and didn't realize there was no update available until it was too late. Now I can't decide if I want to start the game over on Switch, or just continue with this mobile farm. (I invested so much time on my mobile farm)

Also.. stealing your idea for junimo hut area ;)"
StardewValley,itsleeland,that was my first thought too!!! just yesterday I had a bubbly spot I thought I could never reach.... if only I'd known. you learn smth new every day! :D
StardewValley,International-Cat123,"Never turned any into doves myself, but what happens after can be interesting."
StardewValley,Debbie-k,Ruby?
StardewValley,Ragna_Blade,You can give 2 gifts a week
StardewValley,International-Cat123,ü§£
StardewValley,flvorescentblack,"On the first glance i don't know either but what helps me usually is to arrange the things like on the picture on the wiki. You quickly see, where you miss something and what. Also you can look into your collections and maybe figure it out which item is still just a silhouette? :)"
StardewValley,BunanaSnowcone,"Villager will sometimes comments on stuff you sell on vendor (not from the shipping bin), like if you sell vegetables to pierre,he will resell it and sometimes villager will 'buy' them and if its on normal quality, they will say something similar to this (and if you sell higher quality one, frickin pierre will claim he grew those on his back garden). If you never seen it, try selling some stuff to pierre/willy and it might sometimes pop"
StardewValley,TheIrv87,Definitely looks like screen tearing. Try forcing v-sync through your Nvidia control panel or AMD software if the in-game v-sync isn't working properly.
StardewValley,flvorescentblack,"I might want to get it as well, but thought it only ships to the US and not Germany- may i ask where you got it?"
StardewValley,Bananawamajama,"Pro strat is just buy the guy a beer, you're right next to the bar anyway.

Or a pizza"
StardewValley,Bananawamajama,"Don't have to buy and sell. When you're selecting a coop to put it in, the text at the top will tell you what color the chicken is.

Just cancel and try again till it says blue."
StardewValley,evlex,Nicely done! I think it‚Äôs the hardest nonlengendary fish? Quite a feat! üòÅ
StardewValley,Bananawamajama,"If you've done the Shane heart event, just buy a chicken from Marnie.

When you select chicken, it should bring up the map for you to select which coop to put it in.

While on that screen, the text should say ""Select a coop for your new ___ Chicken"" or something.

That way you can tell if the chicken you are buying is white or brown or blue or gold.

If it's not blue, just cancel and try again."
StardewValley,starry-eyed-one,I think this is the ‚Äústop Pierre lying‚Äù mod
StardewValley,TenebrousNova,"They're creepy little bastards. More than once I've come back home to find them just standing there in the pitch black in front of my bed, staring.

From a gameplay perspective they are nothing more than walking hat stands that occasionally get in your way."
StardewValley,Justbeanieisuppose,I'd stand creepily in my mom's room if she stayed in bed for days too
StardewValley,flvorescentblack,I have played at least 200 hours of stardew valley and i just learned that you can change the direction while casting the fishing rod? Oops haha. But great tips!
StardewValley,DimensionDry7760,The only thing that kept me from falling off the wagon with this game is meeting new friends and getting back into the addiction that is COD zombies.
StardewValley,OfficialTrashMan,this is what happens when villagers buy something you sold to willy/pierre. they dont like normal quality items
StardewValley,Neurotic-MamaBear,üò≠ what a great sister
StardewValley,Typical_Ad_4953,Ditto
StardewValley,MettatonNeo1,Unfortunately when I tried to be kind to these people they try to backstab me. That's why I do this
StardewValley,bobbarkersbigmic,If you have the original switch and not the lite the cord comes out of the docking station and can be used as a plug in charger.
StardewValley,smallanimalparty,"My favorite is when a character says ""Pierre showed me a blueberry you sold him the other day. I bought it."" Like imagining Pierre just holding a single blueberry for someone to inspect makes me laugh."
StardewValley,DRmonarch,"Yeah it‚Äôs a fun idea and fun for some players, but as far as aesthetics go, only fits a few styles of farm."
StardewValley,Venerablemom,There‚Äôs that old saw about ‚Äúbringing a horse to water‚Äù that comes to mind lol.
StardewValley,nooneatallnope,"I think most people are just a bit disappointed, because they don't do much. My guess is that CA just wanted to make them as optional as possible, so they don't have dialog or other content attached to them past a few lines your spouse drops."
StardewValley,smallanimalparty,I don't even see how it's possible to only play for one in game day. I told myself I was gonna play for 15 minutes yesterday and next thing I know I'm almost through a whole season lol.
StardewValley,MakingWorkPlay,Same here.
StardewValley,bobbarkersbigmic,"I play this game religiously with my real life kids, and even they are annoyed."
StardewValley,hockiw,"We often see requests for help in designing an attractive farm or what to put in an empty space. But tastes and goals differ so much from player to player that it‚Äôs hard to offer advice that will be useful or appeal to YOU.

The all-time best advice I *can* offer is to hang around these subs, look closely at the posted images of farms, and borrow the bits that you like or appeal to you. I keep a scrapbook of farm screenshot details I like and why I like them. (Is it the lighting? The Bee House layout? The outdoor picnic area? The clever way of hiding a silo?)

StardewValley,EmmyPennyPie,Do the sprinklers work to water the slimes in the hutch?
StardewValley,thewisewitch,Penny could be the teacher at the school :)
StardewValley,No_Film_4518,"I use it for pretty much everything that isn‚Äôt story related, I like doing that on my own"
StardewValley,postcardtohell,"That makes sense! I got rid of the slime hutch awhile ago haha, glad to hear it was the right call!"
StardewValley,beyondrecovery26,"Sorry I don't snoop around people's houses haha :) I do see on  
the wiki there's a note from the daughter, but I don't know if I would exactly  
include that in ""learning early on"" since it's something you have to  
snoop around for and sus out. 

I've searched both their dialogs on the wiki and I don't see  
any lines about their daughter passing away unless I'm missing it? (I don't remember them in game either but figured I should double check since I've played with modded dialogue for a while now).

I don't want to belabor this too much. As I said, I completely understand why people dislike Haley. I'm just tired of the excuses given re: bachelors exhibiting crappy behavior and it feels like a lot of people are citing reasons that you only come to know later on."

StardewValley,HyperboleHelper,"Yes, you can! Just as it says in other posts, when you buy a chicken it says, ""Pick a coup for for your (color) chicken)."" Just keep canceling out until you get the color that you want. 

It's good for early game too, to make sure you end up with both brown and white chickens."

StardewValley,Ready-Charge-8070,I can only play for a little while on PC but on the Switch I can lose hours and hours of time!
StardewValley,Charming_Geologist32,Reminds me of when I gave Sam a common mushroom and he hated it. Then the next dialogue he says he bought a common mushroom at Pierre's for a recipe.
StardewValley,EatTheBeez,"Good god, it all makes sense now..."
StardewValley,Justbeanieisuppose,That's a really sweet reason and I'm so glad video games are helping you with that :) I've used games my whole life to make my body in a way I can control but I'm not sure I've met someone who does the same

StardewValley,Anglophile007,Thank you!
StardewValley,I_love_black_cats,I don't hate them I love them. Probably because irl I can't have kids. At least in games my body isn't against me.
StardewValley,Monstermelisssa,Hailey just put a random plant in the center of the stairs leading to the bottom room. WHAT??? Lol
StardewValley,RustyShackleford131,Because they are a disappointing game mechanic. I expected them to grow up but they get to toddler stage and then stay that way forever. I had kids my first play through but I won‚Äôt do it again.
StardewValley,XxDiamondBlade9,uwu: bruh
StardewValley,Bella_jim,"I think I am gonna try myself first, but sure, I will gladly check it out.

Thanks for sharing :)"
StardewValley,MadamKhaos,"I didn't have kids in the game, mostly because I have a kid in real life and its a no from me. But I've read other people don't because there is no real point in them."
StardewValley,Perle37790,"I feel no need to discuss these events personally. But I will always stand for what's right. It's utterly wrong to ban one word and not another when the word that's banned is a county that is being invaded by another in a heinous manner.

I would prefer they just auto ban the word war and not allow posts with it, but Kent has been in a war so I guess they don't want to do that which seems fair.

But it is unfair to ban one countries name and not another in this circumstance."

I am gonna copy your idea, if you don't mind :p"

StardewValley,objecter12,"I will say that Kent's introduction was a bit of a shock when I first saw him, if. It only because I'd never really stopped to think about life outside of pelican town.

Clean your room? You can see dirty footprints and empty soda (beer?) cans everywhere.

Actually learn how to cook an actual meal instead of frozen pizza?

Did you intend to be a jerk when you send the recipe for Strange Buns, asking us to let you try one, and then when we actually give you one you ask ""why are you giving me your trash?""

Every marriage candidate has growth and development in their arc but Shane just seems to be ""Well, at least he's not a suicidal alcoholic anymore"" and we have to make due with that."

StardewValley,The_Vinegar_Strokes,"**Some notes about this project**

This calculator makes certain assumptions just for the sake of simplicity.

It is assumed that Star Fruit seeds are being purchased as opposed to created through a seed maker. This reflects how I have been playing my farm. I opt to purchase the seeds since the quantity of fruit I can grow has become the main bottle neck in my production. I have not as of yet settled the &gt;!Ginger Island Farm!&lt;.

&gt;!Ancient Fruit Seeds!&lt; have no cost, or opportunity cost associated with them as I do not know the average amount of seeds produced through the seed maker.

My main motivation for this project was determining the viability of &gt;!Fairy Dust!&lt; to speed my production. I wanted to find out in what conditions &gt;!Fairy Dust!&lt; would yield additional profit."

StardewValley,PascalsCat,"A couple tips; one which is a spoiler...

If you plant a grass starter on the last day of winter, it will spread massively the first day of spring. The person I learned this from said something like 28 tiles worth, but only for tillable tiles.

&gt;!Also, if you're having a hard time getting enough fiber to craft grass starter, definitely try to complete Linus' special order, ""Community Cleanup."" He will mail you a recipe to craft Fiber Seeds which uses 1 Mixed Seeds, 1 Clay, and 5 Sap. They do not require water and will even grow in the winter. Harvesting them gives 4-7 fiber.!&lt;"
StardewValley,Coruscafire9,"I always save all of my fiber from day 1 (aside from crafting the requisite scarecrow or two) and make my own. I try to replant a few starters whenever there will be rain the next day so they have 2 nights to grow and get a little more bang for my buck. Make sure to stagger them when you Plant them so they have multiple directions to spread in. I put lightning rods on top so a few spots won't be eaten and can always regrow each day (fences work for this too). Early game you can get a decent amount of fiber from the bug floors of the mine; I usually drop in at floor 15.  

Also, on Winter 28 (the only day each year that this works) make sure to plant a handful of starters all across your farm, like 3-5 in the pen, and another 4-6 elsewhere (to replenish silos ASAP). They will spread up to 40x on Spring 1!"

StardewValley,Andycush00,"Nice work! Question, did you need to craft absolutely everything up to update 1.5?"
StardewValley,NuderWorldOrder,Do you find that helps more than fishing buffs? I would have thought that was the more obvious way to go.
StardewValley,NuderWorldOrder,Seafoam Pudding is even better (+4 Fishing) but it requires a couple exotic ingredients.

StardewValley,PurplePanda285,"Something around 20 million would be enough to buy almost everything you'd need for 100%.

StardewValley,PurplePanda285,Don't skip festivals. Even if you can't participate in the main events. IIRC only the flower dance require you to have good friendship level. Some of the other ones just require you to have certain things. but there's so much to do on the side. You can buy certain stuff only on certain festivals and nowhere else. Also they're fun.

StardewValley,Pass-Timely,Congrats~‚ù§
StardewValley,Some_Guy2465,"Hear me out, you can have a lot of fun with mods, anything you could think of can be done, put all of your boundaries aside. I'm only suggesting this if you're completely done the game"

StardewValley,BraDaDiah91,I would sack the day
StardewValley,DifferentPersimmon74,"It would be very difficult to synchronise your dinosaur and ostrich egg as a ostrich takes 9.5 days to hatch and 7 days to mature so  approximately it will take 16.5 days to lay its first egg that will be 2 weeks and 2.5 days meaning you have to put the egg into the incubator 2.5 days prior to to Monday so you want to put the egg on Saturday at the dawn and it should lay a egg after 2 weeks on Monday at noon or so Now for the Dinosaur egg
So for a dinosaur it takes 12.5 days to hatch and it will start producing eggs  with no maturing time (source - wiki ) so 12.5 days is 2 weeks and a half day which means you can put your dinosaur egg at Sunday at around 4 or 5 pm and it should produce its first egg on Monday 
Here ya go I hope I did not fuck this up smh"
StardewValley,savvyblackbird,"Do any restaurants sell it? I‚Äôm not sure people would want to eat blue fish. It‚Äôs probably looks grey when it‚Äôs cooked. 

So obviously you make sashimi."
StardewValley,Simbertold,"I don't actually think this is true. My first time playing, i didn't wiki anything, and still had a lot of fun. Nowadays i sometimes look up where and when to get which fishes, and that is it."
StardewValley,fake_plasticTreez,"Mmmm, my favorite"
StardewValley,heyitslinope,Dude you have got to chill... even if you dont get to do the quest on time you'll get a chance to repeat it. I dont know why youre expecting the game to be linear with clear markers on what to do but thats not exactly how farming/life simulation games work. The game is not messy it is doing exactly whats expected from a sim game.

StardewValley,kaleidocourse,"The first time I played I thought seasons lasted 30 days despite the game literally showing me they are 28. I also starved my poor chicks for days because I somehow missed the whole needing to purchase hay and I had been so obsessed with clearing the farm I cut all the grass.

I stubbornly refused to look anything up about anything because I was convinced I could figure it out myself and therefore I hated most of the villagers due to their dislike/neutral responses to most of my first week gift attempts."
StardewValley,Galaxy11029,I wouldn't sweat it. Especially with limited G. Stuff comes in (no spoilers) to keep it well and balanced. Good luck spelunker!

StardewValley,savvyblackbird,"Turning your crops into preserves increases the value. The downside is that you have to wait for them, but you can double your money or more. They‚Äôre not as lucrative as Casks, but they‚Äôre worth the trouble. 

Foraged fruit can be used although it‚Äôs not as profitable as crops, so I always preserve my crops first (I save foraged fruit for winter when I might rub out of crops. The upside is they‚Äôre free."

StardewValley,alpha_rat_fight_,Pro Tip in re: flower dance. Don‚Äôt bother going unless you have at least 4 or 5 hearts with someone. Any less than that and they‚Äôll reject you when you ask them to dance. And I heard that hurts a little bit.
StardewValley,ScrogClemente,I am normally able to comfortably able to get away with the freebies as long as you get a prismatic shard before you start the skull cave in the desert. You can trade that for a weapon better than you can buy.

StardewValley,Susan_of_Darmuthia,Can you chop the bush down? You usually can with the bushes on your farm.
StardewValley,sirweebsal0t,"I checked it out. It sounded like your problems stemmed from not wanting to wait on the ramp-up time to achieve full production, which is fair. You have to make sure the pigs have space, you have to pet them every day and plant grass to boost their happiness to get to max levels, and you have to run around picking up truffles to clear the area so more truffles can spawn. It's a lot of effort."
StardewValley,Kjasper,Me too.
StardewValley,Forward-Distance6262,i rage quited most of the time while im fishing then i learned about crab pots

StardewValley,Tobias---Funke,Fishing seems to be in every game now with RPG elements.
StardewValley,sirweebsal0t,"If you're looking at profitability vs time, it actually is better to use preserves vs kegs for ancient fruit. The stat to look at is gold/min. 

Let's assume an unlimited supply of ancient fruit, i.e. it is not the bottleneck and machines are not sitting idle, and let's only compare base prices for simplicity. Also, please check my numbers. 

Sell price
Preserves: 1150g
Wine: 1650g

Processing time:
Preserves: 4000min
Wine: 10000min

Preserves: 1150/4000 min = 0.2875 g/min
Wine: 1650/10000 min = 0.165 g/min

Preserves wins out when looking at profit vs time.

However, like you said, the limiting factor is crop supply, so in terms or profit per item, kegs win out."
StardewValley,MushroomDusty,I love the fishing tbh but it's hard to start with it
StardewValley,doctorforce,All the best for today! Let us know how you get on. ‚ô•Ô∏è
StardewValley,fricky_ricky,"I love fishing it's always my first level 10 skill, it falls off after the community center but it's still really fun. Great money first year, you can make about 5000 fishing a full day and unlike the other skills you can do it as much as you want, i got to fishing level 10 on the start of summer last playthrough. The harder fish are very fun, squids, super cucumber, catfish etc and the legenderies are all fun for me, challenging but possible and feels very rewarding. And the cherry on top, the absolute legend is none other then Willy, every time it rains you know i go get him some gold catfish."

StardewValley,smeppel,Yes the next time you talk to Harvey he'll mention that your ex spouse came by for an abortion. If you play as a girl you get an option the night after your divorce to keep it or have an abortion. If you choose the latter you get an abortion cutscene in the clinic.

still no dinosaur eggs though"

StardewValley,SaphStella,"I used to feel the same tbh. BUT! It doesn't take long to get the hang of it if you actually give it a chance! Granted, Octopi and Lava Eels are literally the WORST, but there's a real benefit to fishing early on when you need that $$$!"
StardewValley,johnpeters42,"You can also give out wilted bouquets (put a bouquet in a furnace) to break up with them after seeing their 10 heart event. (14 heart requires marriage. Yeah, you can divorce, and then maybe wipe their memory so they don‚Äôt stay mad.)

Finally, there‚Äôs a cut scene for having all the girls at 10 without being married, and similar for the guys. There are two versions of each, depending on whether something else is in place or not."

StardewValley,AmethystQ,"Yeah using trap lures. 
That‚Äôs helpful actually I‚Äôll have to dedicate some time to learning their patterns I think"
StardewValley,johnpeters42,"Note that aging cheese gives more g/day than most wines, the exceptions being our old friends starfruit and ancient fruit. (You do have to load/unload it more often, iirc small milk -&gt; regular cheese takes a total of 28 days to hit iridium, while large milk -&gt; gold cheese takes 14. Also the cheese isn‚Äôt obtained all at once, though you could save it up and then throw a bunch in at once.)

Personally, whatever I‚Äôm aging, I just keep a chest near the cellar for stuff waiting to go in, then check it whenever I think about it and unload/reload however much it needs. Easier than spending extra effort figuring out how to keep it perfectly synchronized."
StardewValley,Expertdeadlygamer,Ooh. That makes sense now
StardewValley,Overall_Sandwich_671,I ignored fishing for a long time as well. Eventually I accepted it as a necessary evil to restore the community center. And then when I started my second game I completely forgot how to do fishing s oI had to learn it all over again. I've never been a fan of fishing mini games in RPGs.

StardewValley,BunnyX53,They are super cute
StardewValley,Ashi_moore,"is that natural rock ? this remind that movie poster ""uzumaki"""
StardewValley,johnpeters42,"I would think standard, for max plantable tiles.

Obviously the artisan perk is important when you level up farming skill. With that, truffle oil makes a profit over even iridium truffles.

If you have a shed full of kegs (or whatever), put one outside, wait till they‚Äôre all empty, then load them all at once and the outside one last. Then you can ignore that shed until the one outside is ready. Similar if you fill the quarry with more kegs or whatever.

You can fill literally the entire cellar with casks. Place, load, place more, load more. Upgraded hoe speeds up the unload/unplace process.

Strawberry and other repeaters are individually cheaper, but you get more of them per seed (assuming they‚Äôre planted ASAP and kept watered). Bigger individual crops like cauliflower are worth more to process.

Preserves jar almost always produces more g/day than keg, except for aged wine. (I know multiplayer lets you upgrade cabins to get another cellar, idk whether you can do it in a solo game.)"
StardewValley,pavles711,"worst one is actually iridium bat its strong and hits hard,but the drops are cool tho"
StardewValley,lisonmethyst,"Watching the tv every day and paying attention to the letters you get in the mail basically functions as an in-game tutorial. 

It‚Äôs fine to focus on the skills and activities you enjoy and to ignore the others if you want. Most things get easier as you gain XP and level up your skills (lower energy costs for mining and farming, larger green bar in the fishing mini-game, higher attack level in combat)."
StardewValley,Snapzzzzz,"People always think I‚Äôm weird when I say I prefer stardew valley fishing over animal crossing fishing. I enjoy the mini game so much, and it‚Äôs not too hard for most fish. In animal crossing i either get trigger happy or i react too late."

StardewValley,BeholdingBestWaifu,"Using trap lures too?

It's not easy I'll grant you that, and it tests your patience, but at least it's possible.

One tip I learned a couple years ago, fishes that dart around (Meaning they suddenly move somewhere else very fast and do it somewhat often) dart in pairs, so when they move away you don't have to chase them, since the following movement half a second or so later will almost always land close to where it originally was."
StardewValley,AmethystQ,"I‚Äôve tried. Looked up the best lures, best food and have top levels. I‚Äôm just bad at it ü•≤"
StardewValley,BeholdingBestWaifu,"Consider getting food that boosts fishing, especially for Legend and Glacierfish."

StardewValley,ginger_roar,I tried truffle farming around a month prior to this post and found out there is a lot more to it then buying deluxe barns and stuff. apparently you have to pet them to get happiness up and they'll get more truffles? I'm not sure tho. I also had problems with it (I made a post about it)
StardewValley,ginger_roar,Bruh I might have to stick with Ancient fruit and kegs :|
StardewValley,Affectionate-War-477,Same ! I always do fishing in early game and max it early so that I don‚Äôt have to deal with it later on.

StardewValley,RosatheMage,Adorable.
StardewValley,elissmurfy,"to me, mods are really fun to use when u finish the game and wants to enjoy the map/story.
If u want a easier gaming experience, mods can definitely help u out alot making your day more productive (npc locations, fast access to npc‚Äôs fav gift, easily harvest ur crops, style your charac, style your farm, etc)

it‚Äôs more of a personal preference!

if u dont like keyboards, pc can also use controller to play (open steam in bigpicture mode then, u can use controller) which i find very relaxing"

I‚Äôve never actually eaten a Magic Rock Candy (+5 luck! among other stuff), I should try some time though and see how easy/hard it is to earn back the 3 prismatic shard cost. Lucky Lunch (+3) may also be worth stockpiling the ingredients for."

Don't ever hold the button while fishing, be constantly tapping. It's easier to react. 


Plus, if you tap right before the bar hits the bottom it doesn't bounce, if mistimed it usually bounces less. I have seen suggestions to use the lure that eliminates bouncing, but it is useless with good timing."

StardewValley,Helpweewoo,Ahh this sounds more achievable! Thanks guys I appreciate it!
StardewValley,KSanRa,"Well, they are delicious. And really easy to make! We eat them with fries or mashed potatoes."
StardewValley,FaeryDisturbing,I literally even stand by the living room couch in the morning. This is too much.
StardewValley,Zoot_The_Axolotl,"Mendo bay? Bitch beach (I'm kidding ofc)? Not yo mama's beach? Sorry I'm rather comical with names

Maybe Ferngully gulch?"
StardewValley,[deleted],[removed]
StardewValley,fightingbronze,"So you might actually be unlucky and I don‚Äôt mean that as a joke lol. Before going to the mines I recommend you always check the fortune teller on tv, she‚Äôll tell you your luck stat for the day, and it definitely influences your results in the mine. More likely to find nodes, more likely to fine ladders/holes etc. but if you go on a bad luck day, it‚Äôs the opposite. On a good luck day, I usually start finding iridium nodes by level 20ish of the skull cavern give or take. I recommend bringing some bombs so you can quickly drop down the cavern early into a run. Once you get to the deeper levels it practically is growing on trees."
StardewValley,MagicallyVermicious,"Oh, I forgot. I also collected my last tool upgrade, the iridium trash can."
StardewValley,Mechakoopa,"&gt; we just gravitate to memes when we don't have anything else to do

Not true, I mostly gravitate to memes when I *do* have things that need to get done."
StardewValley,PandorasShitBoxx,do the tappers break upon harvest when they are outside the farm?
StardewValley,alfirlove,"to be able to change your appearance, name, etc ya gonna want to have 4 hearts of friendship with The Wizard and 500g. He let's you visit his basement after 4 hearts are achieved, and there u can find this shrine that let's you change for 500g :)"
StardewValley,ryingpool,Ummmm you can switch your stuff back n fourth?!?
StardewValley,UninformedPleb,"So was the coup successful? Did Robin's upgrade give you enough ""oomph"" to overthrow Mayor Lewis?"
StardewValley,CryptographerSalty74,Howdy!!
StardewValley,punk-rock-vixen,"Mine is more like 
3:00pm in bed
4:00pm i get out of bed and go to computer room
8:00pm i order food
3:00am cry
4:00 am plag more game
6:00 am bed"
StardewValley,SilentMari,This looks pretty good! Green is a nice colour.
StardewValley,Crezelle,My favourite thing to do after my toke walk is to admire my indoor garden
StardewValley,fightingbronze,"I usually go for a barn next, and prioritize that before leveling the coop. This is just personal preference, and I don‚Äôt claim that this is the most optimal strategy at all, just what I do. I try to get the deluxe barn as quickly as I can though because pigs are such a good source of income mid game. That‚Äôs long term though, in the short term if you have a coop but don‚Äôt already have a barn, I‚Äôd get the barn. 1) to diversify your products, and 2) I‚Äôm pretty sure cheese will earn you a better profit at this stage than duck mayonnaise since cows produce milk every day and ducks only produce an egg every other."
StardewValley,maxbailee,Did u talk to them or not that day
StardewValley,stinkyratpee,THIS IS ONE OF THE NICEST COMMENTS EVER!! I am glad and my farmer dude will be back soon with his questionable stardew shenanigans
StardewValley,sydbey_,"You can store an endless amount of clothes, hats, rings and boots in the dressers - no more limited space storing them in chests! Now if only you could add weapons in there as well..."
StardewValley,lIIIIllIIIIl,I'm a big fan of the abandoned places exploration type videos and also the one about old theme parks and stuff. Endlessly interesting. Also I don't even watch anime but some of the animation breakdown videos people do are pretty cool too.
StardewValley,SilentMari,This looks amazing! You've done a splendid job!
StardewValley,Asdfhuk,"Abigail's scene at the mines imo. She wants to act all tough and all, but she gets scared and goes in a corner because of bats. Shows she even has a tender spot despite her looking and acting all tough and all. She's great."
StardewValley,CrashDisaster,I thought I couldn't rotate things either until I clicked A and heard an odd noise then when I placed the furniture it was rotated haha. It's kinda awkward but it's possible. Hope it helps out!
StardewValley,SilentMari,This looks wonderful! I really like the order you've placed the plants in!
StardewValley,coincollector9199,"ohh, ok thanks hopefully I can make my house less of a mess now"
StardewValley,UninformedPleb,&gt;![gramps](https://youtu.be/tB080XmI7SM?t=72)!&lt;
StardewValley,waldenwalker,okay! yeah i have the food in my hands and still pressing the a button :( hmm
StardewValley,SilentMari,Well done!!
StardewValley,CoolanJay,I wish I had friends that liked Stardew lolüòÇüòü
StardewValley,moniqueheartslaugh,"Ah, which is precisely why I switched. But I‚Äôm sure it was a magical experience! I always told myself if I was rich I‚Äôd go back and do it!"
StardewValley,SilentMari,"Wow, that's awesome! You've done a fantastic job!"
StardewValley,c0rpsey,"Looks like it‚Äôs going to exist for real soon! There‚Äôs definitely a market for that! Cool. 

Oh my. That‚Äôs a yummy laptop. Thank you!! I might have to discuss that with my S.O... 800$ ain‚Äôt bad, especially considering we haven‚Äôt actually ever bought a computer... we just keep using the dinosaur my parents gave me for school so long ago. It‚Äôs impressive to me that it still operates so well...:)

I gotta tell you, it feels good to be able to properly read the tech specs. That‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve looked at a sale listing for a computer in a very long time. I‚Äôve been working on my CompTIA certification for about 2 months, and I have definitely learned a few things. I‚Äôm winding up to make a career leap, so my new ability to meaningfully interpret the information is reassuring."
StardewValley,Lady_Paks,"Catfish are super amazing. I normally get them in the fall to help pay for my 2nd half of the season. 1st spring I do mountain lake and my best recently was about 4100 gold made on spring 19 year 1.

I still think the normal speed running methods are impossible in multi-player though without the clock pause.

Always interesting to hear how everyone plays since I know I miss stuff!"
StardewValley,16yYPueES4LaZrbJLhPW,"What drugs make me content with doing nothing but standing for 5.5 hours?

I thought I tried them all, but I want whatever does that. I want that very much."
StardewValley,nothaileym,This is super cute!!!
StardewValley,Couldntstaygone,"That is what i tend to do, i usually sleep 1 am to 12"
StardewValley,[deleted],[deleted]
StardewValley,Couldntstaygone,Standing by the couch for 5 and a half hours is exactly what i did today
StardewValley,iwearsoftsocks,"I never ever have to worry about hay, no matter how many animals i have. I have 1 silo. 

In first year I build a silo and never cut the grass until the last days of fall.
Important is to not completely fill up your animal‚Äôs feeders so you collect hay quicker from the hopper. You collect all the hay from the silo, place it in a chest in the coop or barn. 
Cut grass and repeat. By the end of y1 i usually have about 999 hay"
StardewValley,BinCorb41,Okay! Thanks anyway
StardewValley,SilentMari,"Well done~! That's the first legendary fish I caught, too!"
StardewValley,SilentMari,This is probably the strangest comic I've seen on here. I'd love to see more! This is amazing!
StardewValley,valsavana,"Well, at least no one can ever give you grief when you say ""I divorced my first husband because he was a self-destructive, alcoholic slob"" lol"
StardewValley,Amazing_Bluejay7967,"he never actually says he succeeded at getting sober. Just that he is going to see a therapist, try to drink less and be 'less of a burden'. You still see him go to the bar every single night, not the behavior of someone who used to be an alcoholic and got sober lol! You see that backed up if you marry him, he has beer cans in his room."
StardewValley,ShneekeyTheLost,"It is a 'speedrunning' strat to immediately start fishing off the pier the moment you get the rod from Willy as you can get for your first catch either a Sunfish, which is the 'default' fish when you catch something like seaweed that doesn't give you the minigame, or a Sardine which is required for the bundle. 

Once you get the sardine, you either start fishing in the river for your sunfish if you didn't get one in your first cast, or you head up to the mountain lake to fish there all day. A skilled runner can hit Fishing level 4 on day 2, and I believe the record is Fishing 6 so he just purchased the Iridium Rod on Day 3 to fish up catfish with. Otherwise, you immediately head to Willy's on Day 3 and buy a Fiberglass Rod and some Bait to fish for catfish during the rain, keeping the other bundle fish, dropping them off at your place and trying your luck on the evening of the 3rd for the Eel."
StardewValley,sydbey_,"Well for the skull caverns iridium becomes increasingly more common on lucky days and the further down you go - so that may be why you haven‚Äôt found much there but I haven‚Äôt used the beach farm.. the normal mines I don‚Äôt usually find much iridium there, rarely in the quarry but I get almost all of it from the skull cavern"
StardewValley,kalnu,"I wish there was an npc that would cover for Marnie when she isn't working so she can do whatever it is she is doing when staring at the microwave, but we can still have more consistent hours. 

Pierre is almost always behind the counter, which is one of the things I do appreciate about him, but he really needs an employee to cover for him sometimes so he can take a break. Maybe it would make him less of a dick if he actually had time off with his family. 

Robin seems to have a fairly healthy work/life balance compared with the other two, but even she could use an employee to cover for her, and it could be nice if that was Sebastian on the days where he stands next to his couch for 5 and a half hours doing absolutely nothing. 


I... really want a npc update"
StardewValley,SilentMari,"Ooh, this looks so relaxing! I love it!"
StardewValley,AllieBeeKnits,Alex was actually my first choice but I'm a sucker for romantics like elliot lol!
StardewValley,AllieBeeKnits,"Well I assumed his character would be more happier with the visiting to the therapist, and no longer working at joja mart but nah he still a lil bitch lol"
StardewValley,Forgotten_Futures,"So the Aya Neo doesn't *actually* exist yet, but production samples have been reviewed and it was pretty positive.

StardewValley,Kediset,"ooo, love the look from mod. Als,o that's adorable. Hopefully down the road more features are added for pets in vanilla game o-o (feel like they should protect you from ne'er do wellers who come pickpocketing when you pass out. May or may not be saying this because I accidentally left game running and alas, was not in my house.)"

StardewValley,[deleted],[deleted]
StardewValley,TsaritsaOfNight,"PC, because the mods are awesome. I‚Äôm used to consoles, so my laptop is hooked to my tv with an HDMI cable and I use my PS4 controller. I have about 200 mods... it‚Äôs weird to see my kid playing the PS4 vanilla version."

StardewValley,deadsam28,Just use your joystick to move out to the place you want and hit the A button
StardewValley,Omfgletmemakethis,Willy!
StardewValley,CrashDisaster,I have to hit A when you have the furniture selected. It's a bit hit and miss cause you can't see it turned but you figure out how many times you have to click it to get it where you want

StardewValley,Kediset,My answer was boring.. went with sashimi :3 (I love sashimi.. guess who my fave villager is lol)
StardewValley,shnnrr,For the most part no - I built these all over time slowly adding as I could - the bottle neck for the kegs was the oak resin. You can see why I have a few oak trees still!
StardewValley,[deleted],[deleted]
StardewValley,Lady_Paks,True true. I just know in multi-player the time keeps going with fishing so bopping around at low levels with non  easy fish is not ideal. I've never finished the community center before winter anyway so I admit I ignore the ocean until summer most saves lol
StardewValley,TsaritsaOfNight,"Mods lol. I play on PC (but use an HDMI cable so I can use my tv) and I have a mod that makes it impossible to die in Prairie King. Haven‚Äôt checked for one for Junimo Kart yet. I‚Äôm ok with platformers and stuff, but it frustrates me so I‚Äôm okay with mods. I still get the steam achievements too."
StardewValley,starkiller_bass,During this blessed pandemic
StardewValley,NonCatholicMom,"I was pleasantly surprised to see this on my farm the other day. It's empty now and actually, I can't recall if the capsule is still in my living room or not.  It doesn't disappear, right? Can't check right now but I really want to!!"
StardewValley,Just_Saying_Howdy,Howdy
StardewValley,hypernova13,"It took me until like fall in my first year before I even knew who sebastian was. I'd see his pic in the people list but I'd never run into him. But yes in real life, I am sebastian."
StardewValley,NonCatholicMom,"I'm pretty sure proximity doesn't matter , it's more a factor of if you have one that's not already holding a charge. What I've read is that ~18-20+ ensures that nothing anywhere on the farm gets struck."
StardewValley,ClinkyDink,Do you buy the mats for your kegs?
StardewValley,TheEpicWeeb,Also I realized the fish I was having trouble was a legend fish
StardewValley,Hectelion_,Thanks!

StardewValley,amy1705,I hate Tuesdays in-game. No animals or supplies. No buildings.
StardewValley,c0rpsey,"Lol, sadly, it is a laptop that I use! It‚Äôs from before 2010 and I just keep it plugged in all the time because the battery needs replacing, but it‚Äôs not worth it to me to start fixing it up, I plan to start over with a custom tower when I‚Äôve figured out what I want and decide on a budget! I hadn‚Äôt heard about people making handheld laptops, but it makes sense and sounds amazing. I‚Äôm still inclined to building a big girl though lol."

StardewValley,Connieczyna,"The most upvoted comment in this thread is by ConcernedApe, it was posted about a month ago"
StardewValley,alnono,This was spring year 3 haha so super shortage of iridium. I‚Äôm nearly to the end of spring though and that grandfathers statue plus the general increase in skills and having stuff done was helpful so I‚Äôm doing better for iridium now - will be able to get my final obelisk if I can get those dragon teeth to drop (last Three trips to the volcano rng was not my friend....I‚Äôm only short 3.). But yes! Those are super useful and I will get there...eventually.
StardewValley,[deleted],[deleted]
StardewValley,ClinkyDink,"My friend always dates fixer upper guys who of course can‚Äôt ever be fixed.

StardewValley,_heliophilia,"Now I know!

(probably will carry the bomb in my inventory in the near future)"
StardewValley,livipup,meteor. I think you need a gold pickaxe to mine it. It gives iridium ore and geodes when broken

StardewValley,CelerySlime,"Yes, but how did you miss the 100 other posts just like this though? Karma whore."
StardewValley,DustNstuff,"how many times will i have to say this on this subreddit?

Never. Carry. Bombs. In. Your. Inventory. While. You. Are. On. Your. Farm."
StardewValley,WhiskersWithClaws,"I'll offer a possible solution, but I cannot confirm if it works. Maybe you can test it out and return with the results.

Place a chair next to the pond, but be sure to avoid obstructions such as netting or the bucket.

Sit in the chair, then get off in the direction of the pond. If it works, you should be on top of the pond, allowing access to cut down the tree.

To step off, return to the chair and get up in a different direction.

I've seen people use the chair glitch to access areas on the game, and figured this may allow you to jump on the pond.

I do know the pond isn't actually water because I cut down a tree next to it, which fell toward the pond. To my surprise, the wood and sap landed on top of the pond, but not sink into the water.

Too bad I didn't know about the chair glitch when this happened. I just reset the day."

StardewValley,iGotPinkAcidBootsOn,"The 14 year old part of me *needs* more dating drama amongst the villagers. I need to know backstories not just hints at flirting. Its just wrong to break up Alex and Haley and it seems like Abby likes Sebastian but he‚Äôs either oblivious or not as interested back (despite Maru‚Äôs just ask her out dialogue). 

I know it‚Äôs ambiguous because there‚Äôs not the Harvest Moon rival system and keeps it open for divorce but like‚Ä¶"

StardewValley,fluent_gay,"OP had a bomb in their hand when they went to check on their crops, and ended up placing the bomb. Bombs, when placed, go off automatically and can‚Äôt be stopped, so it blew up the stuff next to it. When using bombs outside of the mines, some items can be permanently destroyed (iirc) and it‚Äôs also very annoying to lose crops like that."

StardewValley,ThePipMeister,"Yeaaah this has been here since the multiplayer optimisation thingie from the latest patch! It was kind of a thing before, but much harder to pull off"
StardewValley,M1dnight_Qu33n,Dang Sam is Goku never would have guessed lol.
StardewValley,thatCaely,OP was about to plant seeds but accidentally used the bomb in the backpack and it blew up that part of their farm.
StardewValley,methseyers,i think this is because smapi updated and said mods haven't been updated as well. what i did was just keep the old smapi installed until the mods i use are all updated as well.
StardewValley,ThePipMeister,"Absolutely! The easiest way to make it work is to just give them your mod folder! My girlfriend plays on Mac, so we sometimes have to remove a few because of compatibility, but even with 138 mods it works great"
StardewValley,GingerScourge,"After she planted the seeds, she switched inventory pages which happens to land on the bombs in her inventory. Then accidentally dropped a bomb. You can get extra inventory spaces by buying the bag upgrades from Pierre and bombs you can either craft or buy from certain vendors later in the game."

StardewValley,arvzi,I've only married Shane and thought the same. Now I am disappointed ... or maybe not? At least she isn't celebrating extra hard bc Shane's gonna leave his frozen pizza trash in someone else's house.
StardewValley,_heliophilia,Oh if that one would have been from Kent I'd be soooo mad lol
StardewValley,mega-gallade,That‚Äôs actually pretty cool! it‚Äôs the same case with most characters too like Abigail likes pumpkins because she carves them with Caroline
StardewValley,WhiskersWithClaws,"You can add sprinklers on the edge and put down a few more crops. I learned about this tip watching a YT video. I didn't know you could put sprinklers on the edge.

StardewValley,RiceAlicorn,"Not to also mention the other problems: how **shit** he is at his job. 


Like, what the fuck, Lewis? Why are so many things run down, and the why the fuck are they only being fixed by the random farmer that took over their grandpa's farm? What the fuck is he doing with the taxes he collects besides spending on vanity projects? 


Also: he made the bet with Morris that he could turn the Community Center into a Joja Warehouse if someone bought a Joja Membership. How the FUCK is it okay to bet a piece of valuable infrastructure on something so flimsy."
StardewValley,Tenshimaia,Thank you!
StardewValley,itsnotthecounty,"The obvious: Lewis, Clint, Pierre. Of course Morris but at least he is open about his intent.

StardewValley,_heliophilia,Haha the horse is like eh whatever
StardewValley,OfficerOvary,Maybe now she'll finally be satisfied
StardewValley,skepticcaucasian,That's what I thought. It's unfortunate. üòï
StardewValley,JustAnotherThroway69,just different dialogue is fine I thought I missed something important
StardewValley,itsnotthecounty,"Also, re: Alex and weightlifting. Alex is insecure about himself and feels sport is all he is ‚Äúgood at‚Äù in one respect (he never excelled academically), and he feels immense pressure to excel in sport because he wants to do his deceased mother proud too. He relies on being typically handsome to boost his self-esteem, which is where we get comments about how he *would* change his hair but girls love it! And all of this considered, other replier is right: not many options for friends. Honestly, I can actually envision other characters being rude/mean to him. 

Also: something that I **love** about romancing Alex with a male farmer is that Alex being finding himself being attracted to/into men is addressed! And sweetly, too. I think Alex is queer-coded in a typical way that the gay jock trope is often presented."
StardewValley,_heliophilia,Oh that's the real pain :')
StardewValley,JustAnotherThroway69,thank you I was worried I missed something good
StardewValley,ereddsIsHere,She can now finally go in hibernation
StardewValley,RiceAlicorn,"The thing I find so unfortunate about Shane is how he continues to provide emotional whiplash, even up to his 14-Heart event. His Heart Events are all about him learning to accept himself, overcome his alcoholism, and take care of him and loved ones, which is great. 


Then there's post-marriage life with him. He talks about still drinking. He feeds kids that you may havr with him like a dumb frat boy. He acts basically like how he did before getting therapy. WTF?"
StardewValley,WhiskersWithClaws,"A little tip for those who find themselves in this situation: close the placement window, wait 30 min, then reopen it. The pet will likely have moved (if not, wait another 30 min).

I noticed this while I went to the bathroom while trying to add a silo. The cat never moved. I thought this very strange, so I closed the window and re-opened it. Sure enough, the cat had moved, allowing me to place my silo.

The benefits of this: if you hit Robin's right before she closes, you can still do this without having to leave her shop. As long as she remains close to the register, you can call up the menu.

Oh, and another tip: if she's walking outside of the register on her way to bed, quickly run behind the register. As she walks by, interact and you'll get the store options.

Another lesson I learned by accident."
StardewValley,TemplarSensei7,Surprised and disappointed NONE OF YOU posted this [link.](https://youtu.be/A3oL7v7PLac)

StardewValley,ehhwhatevr,u didnt visit the desert trader by the bus before going to the skull cavern??
StardewValley,Squatting-Turtle,I just got the game and missed her birthday by 2 days on accident.  Was so distracted with fishing during the past rainy days i forgot to check the calender.   Bummed.
StardewValley,Mucousyfluid,"Jas is Shane's kid. He and his lover were too young and foolish to be parents, Marnie took Jas in, Jas' mom ODed, that's why Shane drinks."

StardewValley,Brassica_Revolution,"Thank you, that helps a lot already! 

Looks like now I need to find out why I don't have them (SMAPI is working, at least I see it every time I start the game). Maybe it needs me to play a full day in-game to load?

Or maybe it's a hint that I haven't installed it correctly."

StardewValley,Algea83,"I don't like it how she says ""I'm in a bad mood, so I might say something offensive."" And then continue with saying something rude. The tone seems rude even if the words are not.

And I, personally, don't like how she circles around Sebastian. Not because I like him but because she's so obviously in the friend zone, and she knows it, and she doesn't like it, and she takes it out on people who just try to say hello. This is my take, so I might be totally off, but these are the vibes I get from her."

StardewValley,hmoates88,"I'm going to try again later, but so far, I'm not having success. It's still saying I have the beta version, even though I keep selecting the 1.20.14 version."

StardewValley,Katviar,"Is there any specific reasons? Is he against all mods or just SVE? I‚Äôm surprised because the mod seems to capture a lot of the original charm still while adding stuff, I‚Äôve only played a little bit of it tho, so maybe there‚Äôs a reason I haven‚Äôt seen"

StardewValley,darthreuental,"That's an interesting take. On one hand, he's the game's creator so I can see why he might feel that way. It's his baby. But having played SVE, I feel like this sentiment does come off a bit snobbish? Maybe high &amp; mighty might be a better way to put it? Or excessively possessive? Trying not to start shit, but there's nothing in SVE that is radically out of line with what's in the base game."
StardewValley,NoBullfrog4258,She looks like a fucking blow-up doll

StardewValley,DutchNDutch,I always loved the mines and was the main reason I started playing the game.
StardewValley,pprblu2015,I love buying them and doing a huge mushroom farm in the fall!
StardewValley,CeruleanTresses,"You don't need to update SMAPI. Version 3.12.2 (the green button) should work fine. You just need to go back to the older, non-beta version of Chests Anywhere: version 1.20.14. You're probably getting an error because you're trying to update to the beta version of SMAPI, which won't work with the version of the game I assume you have.

You can share screenshots by uploading them to Imgur and then linking them here."
StardewValley,DutchNDutch,"Also if you want to 100% the game, you need 3/7/9 hearts with quite some villagers for recipes.

Even if you don‚Äôt walk with 500 apples in your inventory to mass gift everyone at least 2x a like gift a week, try to at least give them a loved gift on their birthdays.

That is a huge increase even if you ignore them for a while."

StardewValley,hmoates88,I'm also getting an error when I try to update SMAPI. And I have no idea how to share pictures/screenshots on here. I'm sure that it's not helping matters.
StardewValley,DoctorKFC,"In my opinion, regular bomb is better because it‚Äôs ingredients are easily obtainable in the skull cave (4 iron ore and 1 coal), compared to the stronger mega bomb (4 gold ore, 1 void essence and 1 solar essence; which only dropped by ghost and mummies). Though some say mega bombs are better, I personally think that the regular one is more than enough if you could place them efficiently!

Yeah! Be sure to bring the gold quality hops because it has decent health boost; also since it will turn to a regular pale ale anyway so it‚Äôs better use is for consumption.

Haha yeah I used to go out the mines at 12AM at most, but there was one time when I was passing out inside the mine and found out I just got a penalty of 1000g.. very small price I‚Äôd say.. and it has became my routine since lol

Good luck on your journey to the deep mines!"

You can buy bombs from the dwarf &amp; either craft staircases for 100 stone each or you can save up jade and occasionally get them from the desert trader! I usually go down w/ 50 normal bombs, 25 mega bombs, around 20 staircases, along with as much food as i can carry &amp; a galaxy sword. Most times the ladders will be near entrances so bombing as close to the ladders will reduce staircase useage.

The only one I can really think of is Demetrius. He only cares about Maru and is always arguing with Robin. Plus, he's definitely overbearing and top protective of his daughter.. And literally doesn't even speak about Sebastian.

I dislike Pam to a certain extent too, but I know pretty well how bad addictions can fuck someone up and she's royally screwed herself."

StardewValley,ACNH_Ellogan,"You can download SDV via Steam, and the download mods via Nexus.  

These are the mods I have used so far:

**Expansion Mods**

- Stardew Expanded ‚Äî expansion mod which adds new NPCs, new town and farm layouts, new fish,  new items, etc.

**Medieval Play through**

- Gwen‚Äôs Medieval Buildings ‚Äî changes the farm buildings to medieval style

**Layout Mods**

- DaisyNiko has a TON of different farm layouts that have cool elements and themes like ‚ÄúTiny Garden Farm,‚Äù ‚ÄúSolo Four Corners,‚Äù ‚ÄúSurvival Island,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCapitalist Dream.‚Äù  I used her ‚ÄúBlackberry Fields‚Äù farm and loved it!
- Oasis Greenhouse ‚Äî expands the greenhouse to have more space, dedicated orchard tree area, and a basement for kegs. (There are many greenhouse layout mods)

**Aesthetic Mods**

- Elle‚Äôs Seasonal Buildings ‚Äî cuter buildings and recolors
- Elle also has a few mods that change the cat or dog looks, as well as the barn animal looks.

**Practical Mods**

- UI Suite ‚Äî Gives your practical info like your skills level progress, how long crops or machines will take, coverage of sprinkler and scarecrows, daily luck, etc.  Super helpful so that you don‚Äôt have to constantly be searching the wiki for basic info.

Hopefully that is enough recommendations to get your started!"
StardewValley,WhiskeyOak258,Just started playing a few days ago. A couple of hours ago I got my wife into playing the game. Now im here scrolling through and ignored while she frustratingly tries to get Elliot to date her.
StardewValley,GuzzlingDuck,"So many things to add though!

Polygamist relationships, permanent speed boosts, different towns and people depending on the farm you chose, more in-depth conversations where you can easily learn what are peoples favorite foods (like, everyone can tell you after awhile), random rolls on weapons, more armor slots, a permanent third accessory slot, better designed mines, ability to slow down time-

Tons of things I want added to the game, haha. Even better spouses, kids, animals.. Better A.I.-

This game is honestly flawed in many ways, but god damn am I still addicted just 150 hours in."

StardewValley,Wordbringer,Wait.. he does? Bruh.
StardewValley,Huntszy,Did you bought that much copper and wood or farmed everything by hand?
StardewValley,cat-in-a-top-hat,"The Chromebook's play store is the same as mobile, so it doesn't have the 1.5 update yet. In your opinion, do you think it's worth buying it off steam to have access to the 1.5 update and its features?"

StardewValley,Emmy0000,Just incase the bowls forget they in your kitchen and not in the Louvre
StardewValley,ducks_and_data,I think every marriage candidate is canonically bi
StardewValley,vanessa_the_weirdo,Guys it's an empty bowl/cup with a tea bag hanging from it. I always just saw it as a wide empty cup with a forgotten tea bag in it.
StardewValley,Few-Tree-9946,"Turns out after checking that I miss only 3 more :-)
The arrowhead, golden mask and bone flute :-D
I should probably dig a lot more on ginger island to acquire more artifact troves ans maybe also purchase some at the desert ibstead of opening those omni geodes.

Btw congrats for your completed collection! :-)"
StardewValley,Adept_Fool,"All trees in Stardew valley are healthy and fresh, but every time you decide to cut one down it was suddenly dead and rotten a long time ago"
StardewValley,Doctor_Fox,Sometimes a character/person is just an unsalvageable incel no matter how much you want them to be better.
StardewValley,heyitslinope,Check the game's version if its 1.5 and above its pretty much up-to-date with content and will include co-op. If you could link the game's page from the play store that would be easier to check because i honestly have no idea whether the chromebook play store's version is the same as the mobile or different.
StardewValley,wiggywigi,"i did, i wanted her sewing machine and her cloth gifts"
StardewValley,IGoStroke,yes
StardewValley,B7iink,"It does take forever to quality them up though, like several seasons long."
StardewValley,heyitslinope,"If you date all of the bachelors, or all of the bachelorettes, a cutscene could get triggered where they will get mad at you, however you can trigger the cutscene and avoid all negative affects by keeping a rabbit's foot in your inventory at all times. 

Marriage will absolutely not get affected. Sometimes, if you gift a marriage candidate a gift while you are married, your spouse might say a line where they are angry/jelous, but thats regardless if youve dated everyone or not.

Last time i played (couple months ago) when you get married your status with your lovers that you've dated dont actually change. It still says ""girlfriend/boyfriend"" unless you break up with them. 



Simply keep a rabbit's foot with you and you should be safe :) note that if the scene triggers and you dont have the foot you will get some negative affects which i think include them not talking to you. Hope this help and if i made any mistakes hopefully someone will correct me."
StardewValley,BestofZoras,He tried to steal Emily from me.
StardewValley,Lennylowe,"I married her because of the cutscene of her having a dream about me and I thought she was gonna have a cool story or something. I was wrong. I legit I was gonna have like a boss battle against her or something, thought she was gonna end up being the witch and we would have a battle to the death."
StardewValley,Ken_Kumen_Rider,When you want every pixel to be as crisp as the air during winter in the valley.
StardewValley,LacerAcer,"I see, thank you."
StardewValley,Terozu,It literally says it right at the beginning and clicking on it causes a giant pixel art banner to pop up and it has the Sub name on it.
StardewValley,bhmantan,"Well, I asked what did you plant? When did you plant them? And when did you find out they're dead?

You can see how long crops need to grow on the description of the seeds/starter. So, judging by the situation you mentioned, you planted beans in Spring? And they're dead because now it's Summer?"
StardewValley,Ok-Director4809,Wait they aren't supposed to be salt and pepper shakers?
StardewValley,Space_man03,I saw Marnie want some joja cola for her cows. Apparently they love the stuff!
StardewValley,Val-Kamri,Is it wrong if it wasn‚Äôt?
StardewValley,gabberooni,boooooo i thought you could &gt;:(
StardewValley,Dependent__Dapper,*yes.*
StardewValley,Alternative-Ad-3041,how did it get even one like tf
StardewValley,Courier_coffee,"So I was right , Demetrius is the worst , it‚Äôs like he is not acknowledging his step son existence at all."
StardewValley,Lennylowe,Sebastian
StardewValley,shell2020,"Yea, I learned about mahogany seeds the last day of the task. So not enough time to do it! Planting heaps now!!"
StardewValley,TheAngryNaterpillar,"I have this mod too and it's one of my favourites! All the NPCs will wish you happy birthday and if you have enough hearts they'll give you a gift too! 

It gives me an incentive to raise my friendship with everyone ASAP"
StardewValley,TrueGoatKing,I always thought it was something to hold like silverware types
StardewValley,wraithspalace,"Accept said statue, bribe her with wine, but passive aggressively block off her cottage in the woods"
StardewValley,_Gunslinger_,I think that's just fruit trees
StardewValley,Winterplatypus,"0) First try holding alt and pressing enter like PsychNight suggested. But if that doesn't work, try the list below.

It's different if you are using linux or mac but I don't want to make this too complicated by giving you every possibility, this is for windows:

1) Right click your start menu windows icon and select ""run""
2) In the little run box that opened type:  **%Appdata%** 
3) Hit enter, this will open up your appdata\roaming folder. 
4) Go down to stardewvalley folder and open it.

This is where all your saves are kept.

5) ONLY delete ""startup_preferences"" file

This will reset all your preferences, like keybinds etc. but it will fix your resolution problem too. Do not delete your saves, do not delete the entire stardewvalley folder."
StardewValley,calliatom,"Unfortunately, no. Stardew Valley doesn't have cross-platform co-op."
StardewValley,PeachWorms,I recently started again after a few years hiatus &amp; am really enjoying the Beach Farm.
StardewValley,calliatom,"The learning curve isn't particularly steep, though I personally would recommend use of a stylus on mobile as there's some parts that are easily fat-fingered (like the fishing minigame). And no, there's no background timers or any other sort of real-time based progression, everything is based on the in-game clock."
StardewValley,iwasbornsomething,Hey nice!
StardewValley,Not-drawing-at-all,"Maru, just because I don't like her. Followed by Elliot. That guy ever heard of consent?"
StardewValley,nonamejx,I am almost 100% in this save file. Except for George‚Äôs dang leeks
StardewValley,GarnetShaddow,"Over the course of the game, I had to talk to him. It comes naturally."
StardewValley,vamp4rz,"she might not be in the right state to recover, or to go through such a difficult path that is recovery. plus her only source of income is driving the bus iirc so she wouldn‚Äôt exactly have time to drive out to zuzu city with her current schedule."
StardewValley,bhmantan,Aaah I see... thank you. I've got pretty much the same setup as you.
StardewValley,PeachWorms,I just started playing again &amp; got Robins hardwood quest too. I haven't unlocked Ginger Island yet &amp; the secret forest only gives 12 hardwood a day &amp; since I only got 6 days to try for 80 hardwood I guess it's not completable for now. I just planted a few Mahogany seeds &amp; put the wild tree fertilizer on them so hopefully next time that quest comes up I can finish it.
StardewValley,bhmantan,battlefield counterstrike?
StardewValley,4everfalling,Always thought of it that was aswell haha
StardewValley,HoomanFireWolf,i thought it was always a ash tray and a ‚Äúdecorative bowl‚Äù was just a nickname for it and those little blobs were cigarettes but now that i think it makes no sense why i actually thought that
StardewValley,1210bull,"I don't have pictures, I didn't take any. They seemed to be growing ok for the first couple days, I watered them and I've got plenty of scarecrows. After a couple days I woke up to dead plants. I'm pretty sure I planted them with plenty of time left in the season, but now I'm doubting myself. Others have suggested lightning strikes, but they died en masse so that doesn't seem right."
StardewValley,Cattle_Whisperer,There's a counselors in zuzu city that could help her with that
StardewValley,ThaNanoAnno,Huh I always thought it was a tea cup and that was a tea bag hanging from the side
StardewValley,vamp4rz,"i mean she‚Äôs an alcoholic, yeah she spends too much time drinking but it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs making a conscious choice to drink"
StardewValley,vamp4rz,"proud shane apologist here,
when i was deep in my depression and suicidal thoughts i wanted to push people away so i was downright rude and ruined a lot of good relationships. shane says that he doesn‚Äôt see a future for himself so it‚Äôs likely that he is distancing people from him so they won‚Äôt miss him when he dies. i don‚Äôt blame u for disliking him though, i wouldn‚Äôt want to be around myself during that time either, but atleast it gives an explanation to his actions other than just being an douche."
StardewValley,Pepperanne_0198,I just gotta ask‚Ä¶ What did you do here?
StardewValley,thewolfauran,"Try to optimize the game through your display card options. If you are using Nvidia, you can do it in GeForce Experience."
StardewValley,MaybeSavvy,I don‚Äôt think people understand how OP fishing is! I got a diamond from fishing on day 5 I think of my new play through.
StardewValley,severityonline,"The vehement capitalist in me says ‚ÄúNOOOOO BUT THE KEGS!!‚Äù

StardewValley,BlueTommyD,SHUT THE FRONT DOOR
StardewValley,yourboiquirrel,pam is the leader of the drinking contest though.
StardewValley,BlueTommyD,Nah it's this known glitch.
StardewValley,Stargirl2151,Ok I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one! I was beginning to wonder if the wiki was wrong
StardewValley,DoctorFuzzy152,TW.         My dogs both passed away in a car accident with me on the way to the vet. I now have one leg from them laying on me üò©ü•∫üò≠üò≠
StardewValley,Ok_Blueberry_5305,"Damn, setting the actual numbers for it makes it seem worth it. I've got grandpa's farm from SVE and cleared out pretty much all the trees like an idiot. Might just stick to a mahogany grove and my tappers"
StardewValley,ArchGaden,"Back in my high school days, my friends and I burned Napster to a CD and buried it with some funeral rites.  Imagine our surprise when Napster was revived years later as a zombie."
StardewValley,sassoswag,lol i've struggled on this soooooooooo much
StardewValley,Butterscotch_T,"Oof. I can kinda relate. I used to want to have every type of fish in a pond, but they were taking a lot of space and weren't bringing in much money for the effort they required, so I removed most of them and got pigs lol. Take this as a lesson on stock market or something"
StardewValley,moxyll,"Non-spoilery answer: One of the lost books that end up in the library gives info on what to do. It's called ""Marriage Guide for Farmers"".

Spoiler answer: &gt;!Go to the tide pool area of the beach on a rainy day, and there's an Old Mariner NPC that will sell you the mermaid's pendant.!&lt;"
StardewValley,MaybeSavvy,That looks amazing! I need to do something like that
StardewValley,amberskye09,"You can make wild seeds, which is what produces what's in the picture. They're made from foraged items"
StardewValley,BVB_TallMorty,"Good point on the first day, I forgot it doesn't rain on the first day. Still, 25 days of 18.3% happening is 99.36% chance, I'd say thats pretty unlikely.

And again, I want to point out that it has been windy every day, not sure exactly but at least a couple weeks in a row. Haven't done the odds on that, but combined with no rain is reaching extremely improbable levels. Feels like it got bug locked onto one weather type"
StardewValley,legoflowers,"Erm no, I‚Äôve never thought about that bro. Damn."
StardewValley,Mustachetacocat,That's what I did then I remembered about it
StardewValley,Guyman-Realperson,"I knew odds weren‚Äôt great, which is why I quadrupled my chances. And they weren‚Äôt cheap ponds to begin with. 3 of them requested Dried Starfish. Not that I‚Äôm hurting for shards. I‚Äôve completed every quest requiring them. I just some some reward from my investment."
StardewValley,Bekkerino,And then you go to the Mines and get an Ancient Seed üëç
StardewValley,StarryEyedBarbarian,Adorable!
StardewValley,_akigami,"Now I'm curious about what was inside that chest.


Guess we'll never learn"
StardewValley,AnarchistBorganism,"According to my math, given an 18.295% chance of rain or storms and three days it can't rain (first of the season and two festivals), there is around a 1 in 156 chance that it won't rain, which isn't exactly astronomical odds. You probably just got unlucky."
StardewValley,Next-Ad-7614,"Thank you, I appreciate that"
StardewValley,gettingtothemoney,My first dog passed away in 2018 and it still hurts to this day. I hope it gets easier for you over time! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
StardewValley,Next-Ad-7614,Posting this did help me get some of the grief out.  Thanks for reading ü•≤
StardewValley,Jaytonitus,"I even tried that, but even with best luck, most of the staircases or holes were found in the last few rocks of each floor. I would focus on killing monsters first to get them out of the way, but even then it was unlucky"
StardewValley,BVB_TallMorty,"There is a 99.5% chance of an 18.3% chance happening at least once in 26 tries. Even higher for 28 days, though fall has 2 event days that don't rain. I realize it's possible, it's just incredibly unlikely. If you also add in the fact that its been windy every day, something is definitely up"
StardewValley,Carr-Peydiem,there are 40... he doesn't have the Joja run. I have 39/40 cause I don't have Fector's challenge
StardewValley,Next-Ad-7614,Thanks.  She died after a really quick illness last September and I feel it really hard like a rock in my heart.  Gotta appreciate everything I have until it's gone?
StardewValley,Carr-Peydiem,39/40 for me... the Joja run is incomplete
StardewValley,Alteriius,"I use [this one](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8107), personally. You can even choose to wear the suit, too, if you want. By default, you'll automatically change when you go to the flower festival."

StardewValley,Successful-Oil-7625,"Is this my ex? When she knew i was getting over alcoholism, she started buying me alcohol so I was dependant on her. But then jokes on her because the alcohol ruined our relationship..."

StardewValley,KhaosElement,"Oh I absolutely meant the specific fish, not the in general one."
StardewValley,kanink007,"Well, if you think the other way, there is a wile 82% chance daily, that it will not be rainy. Maybe the rng is not that wrong."
StardewValley,The-City-Is-A-Drag,You do realize that now you must always plant potatos when you can.
StardewValley,Acrobatic-Parking993,S√©bastian here looks like an anime hero.
StardewValley,Scribz_en,Yay a farm on PEI!! I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre doing this :)
StardewValley,Extension-Confusion8,All of the above. The CD contains a Secret catalogue of bad recipes
StardewValley,BruderBobody,How do I get the mermaid thing for marriage? The mayor sent me a letter about it.
StardewValley,Carr-Peydiem,"Sorry - I edited because it doesn't count as ""caught"" if you buy it, if you just need it for the CC then yes, you could buy it if she has it. I've had some really dry weather farms, seems like it varies quite a bit."
StardewValley,mhofer1984,"Hell,  I'd actually like to see all of them - even though that sounds like a monstrous amount of work."
StardewValley,ImpossibleTap2227,Wait can you actually feed him??
StardewValley,BVB_TallMorty,"Yeah I got the 18.3% from the data. That includes both rain and storms, of which I have had neither. The statistics on this are incredibly slim, and I've read online other people having this issue. Im thinking either a bug or poorly designed RNG are at play"
StardewValley,deblovo,Only local üò¢
StardewValley,mhofer1984,"I'm the opposite. I grew up on a farm. It was a hobby farm to give me and my siblings chores and responsibilities. We mainly raised sheep and chickens. Dad also had a garden for subsistence vegetable farming. My parents own a quartersection of land (a plot 1/2 a mile to a side) and whatever wasn't the yard, pasture or dad's veggie garden, we lease to the local Hutterite colony"
StardewValley,PleasePaper,"My understanding is that it's a Map Editor issue. If you replace inaccessible tiles such as rivers with farmable tile through Map Editor, the Paths layer won't be modified.

It means the modified tiles will remain unpassable to NPCs, including the Junimos.

I suggest you compare your modified map with the untouched default one. My bet is, the two Junimo Huts are placed one ground that was previously blocked off."
StardewValley,deblovo,"I asked him If i could do the BLUE chicken before make It, but he wanted the normal ü§ØüòÇ"
StardewValley,NonchalantWombat,"Hah I will in two seasons! I estimate that, with the artisan perk, I will cash it out for 4620 per bottle, 189 bottles, for a total of 873,180g in 56 days."
StardewValley,kanink007,"You were probably really unlucky. Especially in Yer 1 Fall, it can also be Stormy. So the chance for Rain during Fall year 1 is even less than other years. [Here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Weather_data#Weather_probability_by_type) you can check the chance for weather types."
StardewValley,CryptographerGlum929,I'm busy collecting leeks to get a coffee machine.
StardewValley,BVB_TallMorty,"Thank you, I need to keep remembering to check the cart. Its so easy to forget it. I wish it would rain for other reasons too, really cuts back on my mining time"
StardewValley,[deleted],[removed]
StardewValley,Butterscotch_T,"If I understand everything and maths right, according to the wiki the prismatic shard has a daily 0.09% chance, so to get one 'for sure' you need around 1112 days, so around 40 in-game seasons, so about 10 years. With 4 ponds it should be closer to 2.5 years and you should get a rainbow shell way sooner. Unlucky indeed, but the odds are not great to begin with."
StardewValley,Carr-Peydiem,"Check the traveling cart, she sometimes sells a walleye. Also, you can get 1-3 rain totems from treasure rooms in the skull caverns, would definitely need one for winter since it doesn't rain."
StardewValley,gwaenchanh-a,Also Clint is a creepy incel who won't quit hitting on my girlfriend lmao I'm not gonna pay him for doing shit I can do at home
StardewValley,Letharos,I'll admit this is kinda suspicious though. Who buries a couple of CD-R's? Gotta be something messed up on them.
StardewValley,AppointmentEconomy28,You have to tell us what your cash in for this load was!
StardewValley,BVB_TallMorty,"Nice work, may I request best girl Leah next? Lol"
StardewValley,TrinixDMorrison,Amazing as always! :3
StardewValley,RetroBowser,"Late to the party but for everyone on all platforms, advanced crafting information in your in game settings helps a lot for this. Shows you how many of each item you have crafted, works on food too I think even though there's a menu for that in your inventory."
StardewValley,GPlayer435,Thank you!
StardewValley,PSILighting,That might be it but I know that‚Äôs been a thing for a while on the PC version that was before the new content dropped. Might just be an oversight on the mobile port that may or may not be fixed.
StardewValley,Letharos,TRANSCENDOG!!!
StardewValley,radsince98,I love this! Omg!
StardewValley,AppointmentEconomy28,So cute! I would live in this house any day
StardewValley,lkuecrar,I found a cd someone burned for their car in a ditch one time. It had All Star from Shrek on it lmao
StardewValley,espresso_knight_,Jesus Christ this makes it infinitely worse
StardewValley,AppointmentEconomy28,"From the looks of it, you still have a lot to unlock and complete. The farm looks beautiful but don‚Äôt let it prevent you from enjoying the rest of the game"
StardewValley,moxyll,"Completing the community center will make couple new quests available. One unlocks new farm buildings, the other unlocks a new area with a whole bunch of new stuff to do. The new area is not available if you're playing on mobile (it was added in 1.5, mobile is still on 1.4).

Until then, do whatever makes you happy. Some folks like to do everything (look on the inventory tab with what you have shipped, fished, cooked, etc), some like to make as much money as they can, others enjoy hanging out and fishing.

It's also OK to be done with the game if you've done all you want!"
StardewValley,Plugh88,"You're right. I hadn't thought of Penny in those terms before, but now that I do, I see her as the sort of narcissist who gets attention through their good works. This means that she lacks empathy, so she wouldn't understand why George was (rightfully) upset. Such people can be a great boon to the world, but typically treat those closest to themselves shabbily. Mrs. Jellyby in Dicken's *Bleak House* us a satirized example of such people.

If all this is in fact true for Penny, then the reality is that she is not going to change. In a realistic portrayal of her marriage she would, like Mrs. Jellyby, be neglectful of her spouse and children. Instead she would put all her energy and attention into her role as village teacher to the admiration of the wider community."
StardewValley,verumew,Thank you!! ‚ô°
StardewValley,Serious-Lee,Oh damn I didnt even think of triple shot espresso.  I need to bring more lucky food too!
StardewValley,DwighteMarsh,How is that fireplace venting smoke?
StardewValley,1WURDA,"There is some endgame stuff after completing the CC that should keep you busy for a while longer.  I'm also not much of a make friends with the townspeople person but this playthrough I'm just buying 100s of salads and giving them to everyone, and it's a nice change of pace/way to break up the monotony when you get the random cutscenes just going about your business.  Really does add something to the game I think."
StardewValley,AceyAceyAcey,Exactly.
StardewValley,AppointmentEconomy28,COOL! I love it!
StardewValley,CocaineAndWholeFoods,I think you‚Äôre right! The proportions match
StardewValley,DaybreakNightfall,Was it AOL or EarthLink? Lol
StardewValley,quartzquandary,Thank you!
StardewValley,quartzquandary,I appreciate them so much! Gus was over the moon when I gave him a flower for his birthday haha
StardewValley,Strugglebearr,Haven't seen anyone mention it yet- it could be a Playlist from an old lover. Looks purposely snapped. Probably buried after a breakup.
StardewValley,gwaenchanh-a,Having to go across town during work hours versus just chucking them all in in the morning and collecting them again when you get home. If you have a really busy day or you're working on Ginger Island or something that takes a huge chunk out of your time
StardewValley,mhofer1984,So...Haley. I always got a 'high-school-cheerleader-queen-bee' vibe from her.

StardewValley,2pnt1,So I‚Äôm trying to play SDV on my MacBook with an Xbox controller. I can get the controller to pair but I can‚Äôt control anything in game. Any ideas?

Usually keep like 30ish or more on hand at any given time though."
